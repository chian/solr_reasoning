# User Query
Get all coding sequences (CDS) for a Pseudomonas aeruginosa genome.

# Attempt 1

## Original Superprompt (before enhancement)
Given the user's initial prompt "{user prompt: Get all coding sequences (CDS) for a Pseudomonas aeruginosa genome.}" enhance it. 1. Start with clear, precise instructions placed at the beginning of the prompt so that you generate fast-running SOLR commands that demonstrate the solution approach but limit the output to keep runtime short while providing a solution to the specific query. 2. Include specific details about the desired context, outcome, length, format, and style. When generating your chain-of-thought (<think>), keep it brief. Then produce the final commands in <action> tags. IMPORTANT: Commands in <action> tags MUST be in JSON format with "action" and "action_input" fields, like this:
    <action>
    {
        "action": "bash",
        "action_input": "your command here"
    }
    </action>
3. Provide examples of the desired output format, if possible. 4. Use appropriate leading words or phrases to guide the desired output, especially if code generation is involved. 5. Avoid any vague or imprecise language. 6. Rather than only stating what not to do, provide guidance on what should be done instead. Remember to ensure the revised prompt remains true to the user's original intent.

    To query an endpoint, it's added to the url: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome
    solr query parameters are added after, for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?eq(genome_id,<genome_id>)&select(genome_id,genome_name)&limit(2)
    multiple conditions conditions can be specified using 'and' and 'or', for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genome_id,<genome_id>),eq(genus,<genus>))

Other tips:
    - Use `limit(1)` (or fewer) to cap the result size
    - Use a small set of columns (e.g., `select(feature_id,product))` to avoid retrieving 
    unneeded data.
    - Avoid overly complex filters or joins unless absolutely necessary.

    Examples:

    User Query: List all genomes associated with *Escherichia coli*. 
    Response:
    <think>
        First, identify the relevant commands needed to complete the task and get the associated documentation. 

        The genome collection can be used here, looking at documentation:
        ```
        bash
        cat api_docs/genome.txt
        ```

        To target *Escherichia coli*, we use filters for the genus and species fields. Genomes can be retrieved from the genome collection.

        The final command is:
        ```
        bash
        curl -L -H "Accept: application/json" 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli))&limit(1)'

## Enhanced Prompt from o1-preview
Retrieve coding sequences (CDS) for a *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* genome using fast-running SOLR commands. Limit the output to keep the runtime short while providing a solution to the specific query. Include specific details such as the genome name, feature type, and limit the results to a small number. Format the commands in JSON with "action" and "action_input" fields within `<action>` tags, like this:

```
<action>
{
    "action": "bash",
    "action_input": "your command here"
}
</action>
```

Provide examples of the desired output format, if possible. Use precise language to guide the desired output, especially for code generation. Avoid any vague or imprecise language. Ensure the revised prompt remains true to the original intent.

<think>
To retrieve CDS features for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, we can query the `genome_feature` collection. We'll use filters for `genome_name` and `feature_type`. The query will be limited using `limit(1)` and we'll select specific fields like `feature_id` and `product` to reduce output size. The final command will use `curl` to access the API endpoint.
</think>

<action>
[
    {
        "action": "bash",
        "action_input": "curl -L -H \"Accept: application/json\" 'https://bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome_name,Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa),eq(feature_type,CDS))&select(feature_id,product)&limit(1)'"
    }
]
</action>

## LLM Response
<think>
The solution uses the BV-BRC API to query CDS features for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The command:
1. Filters by genome name ("Pseudomonas aeruginosa") and feature type ("CDS")
2. Limits to 1 result with `&limit(1)` for faster execution
3. Selects only required fields (feature_id, product) to minimize data transfer
4. Uses JSON output format for structured parsing

Example output format:
```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "items": [
    {
      "feature_id": "fig|208964.12.peg.1",
      "product": "chromosomal replication initiator protein DnaA"
    }
  ]
}
```
This provides essential CDS information while maintaining quick execution.

## LLM Response
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the right approach here. The user wants to get all coding sequences (CDS) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Let me look at why the previous attempts failed.

In Attempt 1, they used the command 'json', which doesn't exist, so it failed. They probably meant to output a JSON but mixed up the command.

Attempt 2 used a series of commands piped together: esearch, elink, efetch. But the error was a syntax error, probably because the way the commands were joined with a pipe. The command was split into parts with a pipe as a separate list element. Maybe that caused the shell to not parse it correctly, leading to a syntax error. Also, when using tools like esearch and elink from the E-utilities, you need to ensure proper formatting of the pipeline.

Let me think about how to structure the command correctly. Using esearch to query the genome database for Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the latest and refseq filters. Then, elinking to protein, but maybe the target should be the protein database. Then efetch to get the sequences in FASTA format.

Wait, but CDS are usually in the nucleotide entries. Maybe the elink step was incorrect. If the goal is to get CDS features, perhaps we should fetch the GenBank files and extract CDS features. Alternatively, use the nucleotide database and extract CDS from there.

Alternatively, maybe they tried to link from genome to protein entries, but the path might not be straightforward. The NCBI E-utilities require correct database transitions. Let me check the correct pipeline.

Another approach: Use esearch on the genome database to find the latest RefSeq genomes for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. From those, get the nucleotide entries (which would be the genome records), then use efetch to get the GenBank file, which includes CDS features. Then parse the GenBank file to extract CDS sequences. However, the user might need just the CDS in FASTA format.

Alternatively, the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) has an API that allows directly downloading CDS in FASTA format. For example, using their URL parameters to get the CDS.

Wait, maybe using EDirect correctly. Let's think. The correct E-utilities pipeline for getting CDS would be:

1. Search the Genome database for the organism with the given filters.
2. Get the nucleotide IDs linked to those genomes (maybe via elink to nuccore).
3. Then fetch the CDS features from those nucleotide entries.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The Genome database entries (like assembly accessions) have links to the nucleotide database entries (the chromosomes/contigs). Then, those nucleotide entries have CDS features. To get the CDS sequences, perhaps we need to retrieve the GenBank files and extract the CDS regions, but that would require local processing. Alternatively, NCBI might allow fetching CDS sequences directly in FASTA format.

Wait, maybe using efetch with the correct parameters. For example, using -feature CDS and -format fasta_cds_aa would fetch the coding sequences in amino acid FASTA. But if we need nucleotide sequences, maybe use -format fasta_cds_na.

Wait, let me check the efetch documentation. The -format parameter can take 'fasta_cds_aa' for amino acids and 'fasta_cds_na' for nucleotides. So perhaps the original attempt tried to use 'fasta_cds_aa' but maybe there was an issue with how the pipeline was structured.

In Attempt 2, the commands were split into a list with the pipe symbol as a separate element. Maybe that caused the shell to treat the pipe as a separate command, leading to a syntax error. When passing commands as a list, each element is a part of the command. For example, if you join them with pipes properly in a single string, it might work.

So, perhaps the correct command is a single pipeline:

esearch -db genome -query "Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND latest[filter] AND refseq[filter]" | elink -target protein | efetch -format fasta_cds_aa > pa_cds.faa

Wait, but why link to protein? If the original genome entries are in the genome database, linking to protein would get the protein entries related to those genomes. But CDS features are in the nucleotide entries. So maybe the correct target is nuccore (nucleotide database) instead of protein.

Ah, that's probably the mistake in Attempt 2. They used '-target protein', but CDS sequences are in the nucleotide entries. Let me correct that.

So the correct steps would be:

1. Use esearch on the genome database to find the desired genomes.
2. Use elink to get the related nucleotide entries (from the nuccore database).
3. Use efetch to get the CDS features in FASTA format.

So the pipeline should be:

esearch -db genome -query '...' | elink -target nuccore | efetch -format fasta_cds_na > output.fasta

Wait, but then the elink would get the nucleotide sequences (the genomic records), and efetch with -format fasta_cds_na would get the CDS regions as FASTA.

So putting it all together in a single command line:

esearch -db genome -query "Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND latest[filter] AND refseq[filter]" | elink -target nuccore | efetch -format fasta_cds_na > pa_cds.fna

This should retrieve all CDS nucleotide sequences from the latest RefSeq genomes of P. aeruginosa. The error in Attempt 2 was targeting protein instead of nuccore, leading to fetching protein sequences (amino acids), or maybe not the CDS at all. Also, the pipe in the command may have been split incorrectly when passed as separate list items. So combining the commands into a single pipeline string might fix the syntax error.

Another possible issue is the use of the pipe symbol in the command list. If the commands are split into separate elements in a list like ["esearch ... |", "elink ... |", ...], the shell might not parse them correctly, leading to syntax errors. Instead, the entire pipeline should be a single string to be executed by the shell with proper pipe handling.

Therefore, the correct approach is to run the entire pipeline as a single command string, using correct targets and formats.

Also, checking if the EDirect tools (esearch, elink, efetch) are installed and available in the environment. Since the previous attempts show errors related to command not found or syntax issues, but assuming that in this context the EDirect tools are available, as the second attempt tried to use them.

So the final command would be a single line:

esearch -db genome -query "Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND (latest[filter] AND refseq[filter])" | elink -target nuccore | efetch -format fasta_cds_na > pa_cds.fna

This should perform the search in the genome database, link to the nucleotide entries, fetch the CDS sequences in FASTA format (nucleotide), and save to pa_cds.fna. Also, using parentheses in the query might help, but sometimes the query syntax can be tricky. But in the original attempt, the query was similar except for the parentheses. Alternatively, adjust the query as needed.

Another thing to note: if the genome entries have multiple associated nucleotide records (like chromosomes or plasmids), the elink will retrieve all their UIDs, and efetch will process them. Also, specifying 'latest[filter]' ensures only the latest RefSeq assemblies are considered, so we get the most up-to-date genomes.

Thus, the corrected command should work, addressing the issues in the previous attempts by targeting nuccore instead of protein and ensuring the pipeline is correctly structured as a single command.

["esearch -db genome -query 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND latest[filter] AND refseq[filter]' | elink -target nuccore | efetch -format fasta_cds_na > pa_cds.fna"]
</action>

<thought>
The previous attempts failed due to incorrect database targeting and command structure. 

1. **Database Target**: Attempt 2 used `-target protein`, but CDS sequences are stored in nucleotide records (nuccore). Switching to `-target nuccore` fixes this.
  
2. **FASTA Format**: Using `fasta_cds_na` retrieves nucleotide sequences instead of amino acids (`fasta_cds_aa`), which better matches the "coding sequences" request.

3. **Pipeline Structure**: The pipeline is now consolidated into a single command string to avoid shell syntax errors. The entire ESearch-ELink-EFetch chain is connected with pipes properly.

4. **Query Adjustment**: Removed redundant parentheses in the query to simplify syntax while retaining the same logical filters (latest RefSeq genomes).

This approach directly fetches CDS nucleotide sequences from the correct database with proper formatting.

## LLM Response
<think>
Alright, let's think through this problem. The user wants to retrieve all coding sequences (CDS) for a Pseudomonas aeruginosa genome. Previous attempts have failed, so I need to figure out why and adjust accordingly.

Looking at Attempt 1: The command was 'json', which clearly doesn't make sense here. The error says the command isn't found, so maybe the user tried to output JSON but used the wrong approach. Not sure why 'json' was the command—probably a mistake.

Attempt 2 used a series of E-utilities commands. The command tried to chain esearch, elink, and efetch. The error was a syntax error in the pipe. Wait, the command was split into parts with pipes but maybe the way the pipes were structured caused the problem. The first part ended with a pipe |, and then the next command starts with elink. Maybe when these are executed as separate commands, the shell is getting confused. For example, the pipe operator | needs to be part of the same command line. If the commands are split into separate strings with pipes at the end, the shell might not parse them correctly, leading to syntax errors. So, the error here is likely due to incorrect command chaining or improper use of pipes.

Attempt 3 failed because the assistant didn't generate a valid command, so the parsing failed. So, the response must be properly formatted in JSON within the <action> tags.

So, what's the correct approach? Let's recall how E-utilities work. To get CDS from a genome, perhaps through NCBI's databases. The plan is:

1. Use esearch to find the genome entries in the Genome database. The query would be 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn]' with filters for latest and RefSeq. 

2. Link from Genome to protein entries, but wait—Genome entries might link to other databases. Alternatively, perhaps better to get the protein records directly. Alternatively, maybe retrieve the GenBank file of the genome and extract CDS features. But using the E-utilities to fetch CDS sequences.

Wait, but the user wants CDS sequences. The NCBI Genome database has genomes, and each genome may have links to proteins or nucleotide entries. Alternatively, perhaps the Nucleotide database has the genome records (like RefSeq assemblies) which have CDS annotations.

Alternatively, maybe using the nuccore database (Nucleotide) to retrieve the genomic sequences with CDS features. For example, using efetch with a query that retrieves the CDS regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants protein coding sequences, which would be the translated amino acid sequences (like in FASTA format), but the term CDS usually refers to the nucleotide sequences coding for proteins. But the user didn't specify, but in the previous attempts, Attempt 2 tried to fetch protein (using elink -target protein), which would give protein entries linked from the genome, but maybe not the actual CDS regions from the genome.

Hmm. Let's clarify the goal: Get all CDS for a Pseudomonas aeruginosa genome. So, likely they want the nucleotide sequences of all CDS features from a specific genome, or all genomes? The query says "a" genome, so probably the latest RefSeq assembly.

The correct approach might be:

1. Find the latest RefSeq genome for Pseudomonas aeruginosa using esearch on the genome database.

2. Get the GenBank file of that genome, which includes the annotations.

3. Extract the CDS features from the GenBank file.

But perhaps the user wants to retrieve the CDS sequences directly in FASTA format. Using NCBI's efetch with the appropriate parameters.

Alternatively, using the elink from genome to nuccore (the nucleotide entries for the genome), then fetch the CDS features.

Alternatively, maybe using the following steps:

- Search the Assembly database for the latest RefSeq assembly of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. But perhaps the Genome database is better for this.

Wait, the first attempt used "genome" as the database. Let me verify.

The esearch command in Attempt 2 was: esearch -db genome -query '...'

The genome database includes entries for whole genomes. Using that, and then linking to protein may not give the CDS. So perhaps after getting the genome entry, we need to link to the nucleotide (nuccore) entry for the genome, then fetch the CDS features.

Alternatively, maybe the genome entry has a link to the BioSample or BioProject, but that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to directly search the nucleotide database (nuccore) for the RefSeq genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and then retrieve the CDS regions.

Wait, let's think. The RefSeq genome would have an accession like NC_XXXXXX for chromosomes or whole genomes. For example, searching in nuccore for the organism and with the latest RefSeq filter, then using efetch to get the CDS in FASTA.

Alternatively, the user can get the CDS features by using the -feature option in efetch. For example:

esearch -db nuccore -query 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND (latest[filter] AND refseq[filter])' | efetch -format fasta_cds_aa

But wait, the format "fasta_cds_aa" would retrieve the amino acid sequences of the CDS (protein), whereas "fasta_cds_na" would give the nucleotide sequences of the CDS.

Alternatively, maybe the appropriate format is 'fasta_cds_na' for CDS nucleotide sequences. However, perhaps the right approach is:

1. Use esearch on the nuccore database with the organism and RefSeq latest filters.

But wait, nuccore contains individual nucleotide sequences. If the user wants the entire genome's CDS, they need to retrieve the genome record (which is a single nucleotide entry for the complete genome) and then extract the CDS features.

But in that case, using efetch with the option to extract CDS features. For example:

esearch -db nuccore -query 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND (latest[filter] AND refseq[filter])' | efetch -format gbwithparts

Then parse the GenBank file to extract CDS features. But the user might prefer a direct way to get the CDS sequences in FASTA.

Ah, here's a way: using the -feature option in efetch. For example, using the following command:

esearch -db nuccore -query 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND refseq[filter] AND latest[filter]' | efetch -format fasta_cds_na

This would return the CDS regions in FASTA format for the nucleotide sequences matching the query.

But perhaps there are multiple entries (like multiple chromosomes or plasmids). The latest filter might pick the most recent, but maybe we need to target the specific genome.

Alternatively, maybe adjust the query to get the complete genome entry. For example, including 'complete genome' in the query.

Wait, the original attempt used [orgn], latest and refseq filters. But maybe the issue is that the genome database entries don't directly link to the CDS. Instead, the actual CDS sequences are in the nuccore database as part of the genome record.

So, changing the database from 'genome' to 'nuccore' in the esearch command. Let's test that.

Alternatively, perhaps the user should first retrieve the genome entry from the 'genome' database, then link to nuccore to get the nucleotide entries, then fetch the CDS features.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Search the genome database for the latest RefSeq Pseudomonas aeruginosa genome.

   esearch -db genome -query 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND latest[filter] AND refseq[filter]'

2. Link to nuccore to get the associated nucleotide entries (the genome sequences).

   elink -target nuccore

3. Fetch the CDS features in FASTA format.

   efetch -format fasta_cds_na

Combining these commands into a pipeline:

esearch -db genome -query 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND latest[filter] AND refseq[filter]' | elink -target nuccore | efetch -format fasta_cds_na > pa_cds.fasta

This should work. Let's check the previous errors. Attempt 2 had a pipe after the elink command, but the way the command was split into separate parts with pipes at the end caused a syntax error. The correct way is to chain the commands with pipes in a single command line.

In the second attempt, the user tried to split the commands into separate parts with ' |' at the end of each line, which might not have been correctly parsed by the shell. Instead, the entire pipeline should be a single command without splitting into separate strings. So, the command should be written as a single line or properly joined.

Therefore, the correct command should chain esearch, elink, and efetch together with pipes, and output to a file. Also, the database should be genome, then linked to nuccore, then fetch the CDS as FASTA.

Additionally, the previous Attempt 2 tried to target protein, but perhaps that's why it retrieved proteins instead of CDS. By targeting nuccore, we get the nucleotide entries, and then fetching as fasta_cds_na gives the CDS nucleotide sequences.

Another possible error in Attempt 2 was using the wrong output format. Using 'fasta_cds_aa' would retrieve amino acid sequences (proteins), but the user wants CDS, which are nucleotide sequences. So the correct format is 'fasta_cds_na'.

Putting it all together, the command should be:

esearch -db genome -query 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND latest[filter] AND refseq[filter]' | elink -target nuccore | efetch -format fasta_cds_na > pa_cds.fasta

This should search the genome database for the latest RefSeq entry of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, link to the corresponding nucleotide entries in nuccore, and then fetch the CDS regions in FASTA format, saving them to pa_cds.fasta.

I need to make sure that the pipeline is correctly structured as a single command. The previous Attempt 2 had each part as a separate command in an array, which might have led to improper piping. In a shell, the entire pipeline is written as a single command, connected by pipes. So presenting the command as a single line within the JSON action should work.

<action>
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "command": "esearch -db genome -query 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa[orgn] AND latest[filter] AND refseq[filter]' | elink -target nuccore | efetch -format fasta_cds_na > pa_cds.fasta",
      "description": "Fetch CDS nucleotide sequences in FASTA format by: 1) Searching Genome DB for latest P. aeruginosa RefSeq, 2) Linking to nucleotide records, 3) Extracting CDS features"
    }
  ]
}
</action>

<thought>
The previous attempts failed due to command syntax errors and database/target mismatches. Attempt 2 tried to link to protein records (elink -target protein) which would return amino acid sequences rather than CDS nucleotide sequences, and had improper pipe handling. 

This solution:
1. Uses genome database to find the latest RefSeq genome
2. Links to nuccore (nucleotide entries) instead of protein
3. Uses fasta_cds_na format to get CDS nucleotide sequences
4. Maintains the pipeline as a single continuous command to avoid syntax errors
5. Directs output to a file with > redirection rather than multiple steps
