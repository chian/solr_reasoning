Specialty gene reference record: Represents a specialty gene reference and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

A specialty gene reference record describes a reference gene of interest (e.g., AMR, virulence), including identifiers, function, classification, and metadata. These records are used for annotation and comparative genomics.

Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the specialty gene reference. Example: SPGR_00001
- gene_id: Gene identifier. Example: "b0001"
- gene_name: Name of the gene. Example: "blaCTX-M"
- function: Function of the gene. Example: "beta-lactamase"
- product: Product name or description. Example: "Beta-lactamase enzyme"
- classification: List of classification terms. Example: ["AMR"]
- antibiotics: List of antibiotics associated. Example: ["ampicillin"]
- antibiotics_class: Class of antibiotics. Example: "beta-lactam"
- assertion: Assertion for the gene. Example: "experimentally validated"
- genus: Genus of the organism. Example: "Escherichia"
- species: Species of the organism. Example: "coli"
- organism: Name of the organism. Example: "Escherichia coli"
- locus_tag: Locus tag. Example: "b0001"
- gi: GenInfo Identifier. Example: "123456"
- pmid: List of PubMed IDs. Example: ["12345678"]
- property: Property of the gene. Example: "resistance"
- source: Source of the gene data. Example: "RefSeq"
- source_id: Source-specific ID. Example: "NP_414543.1"
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- Specialty gene references are used for annotation and comparative genomics.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
