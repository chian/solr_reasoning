Strain record: Represents a biological strain and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

A strain record describes a biological strain, including identifiers, host, collection, and segment information. Strains are used for epidemiological, evolutionary, and comparative studies.

Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the strain. Example: STR_00001
- strain: Strain designation. Example: "K12"
- species: Species of the organism. Example: "Escherichia coli"
- genus: Genus of the organism. Example: "Escherichia"
- family: Family of the organism. Example: "Enterobacteriaceae"
- host_name: Name of the host. Example: "Homo sapiens"
- host_common_name: Common name of the host. Example: "human"
- host_group: Host group. Example: "mammal"
- lab_host: Laboratory host. Example: "E. coli"
- passage: Passage history. Example: "passaged 3 times"
- collection_date: Date of sample collection. Example: "2020-05-01"
- collection_year: Year of sample collection. Example: 2020
- isolation_country: Country of isolation. Example: "USA"
- geographic_group: Geographic group. Example: "North America"
- segment_count: Number of segments. Example: 8
- segment fields (1_pb2, 2_pb1, 3_pa, 4_ha, 5_np, 6_na, 7_mp, 8_ns, l, m, n_type, other_segments, s): Segment information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
- genbank_accessions: List of GenBank accessions. Example: ["U00096.3"]
- genome_ids: List of genome IDs. Example: ["83332.12"]
- status: Status of the strain. Example: "active"
- subtype: Subtype designation. Example: "H7"
- h_type: H type. Example: 7
- taxon_id: NCBI Taxonomy ID. Example: 83332
- taxon_lineage_ids: Taxonomic lineage IDs. Example: [83332, 562]
- taxon_lineage_names: Taxonomic lineage names. Example: ["Bacteria", "Proteobacteria"]
- owner: Owner of the record. Example: "user@bv-brc.org"
- public: Whether the record is public. Example: true
- user_read: Users with read access. Example: ["user1", "user2"]
- user_write: Users with write access. Example: ["user1"]
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1
- 1_pb2: Segment 1 PB2 information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
- 2_pb1: Segment 2 PB1 information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
- 3_pa: Segment 3 PA information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
- 4_ha: Segment 4 HA information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
- 5_np: Segment 5 NP information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
- 6_na: Segment 6 NA information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
- 7_mp: Segment 7 MP information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
- 8_ns: Segment 8 NS information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
- l: Segment L information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
- m: Segment M information. Example: ["segment1", "segment2"]
