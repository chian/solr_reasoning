Protein structure record: Represents a protein 3D structure and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

A protein structure record describes a resolved or predicted 3D structure of a protein, including identifiers, sequence, method, resolution, and related metadata. Structures are linked to protein features and genomes.

Fields:
- pdb_id: Unique identifier for the protein structure (PDB ID). Example: 1A2B
- feature_id: Identifier of the associated protein feature. Example: fig|83332.12.peg.1
- patric_id: PATRIC-specific feature ID. Example: fig|83332.12.peg.1
- genome_id: Identifier of the parent genome. Example: 83332.12
- organism_name: Name of the organism. Example: Escherichia coli
- gene: Gene symbol(s) associated with the structure. Example: dnaN
- product: Product(s) described by the structure. Example: DNA polymerase III subunit beta
- sequence: Amino acid sequence(s) of the protein. Example: "MSTNPKPQR..."
- sequence_md5: MD5 checksum(s) of the sequence. Example: 1bc29b36f623ba82aaf6724fd3b16718
- alignments: List of alignment identifiers. Example: ["align1", "align2"]
- authors: Authors of the structure publication. Example: ["Smith et al."]
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- file_path: Path to the structure file. Example: "/structures/1A2B.pdb"
- institution: Institution responsible for the structure. Example: "Broad Institute"
- method: Experimental or computational method(s) used. Example: ["X-ray crystallography"]
- pmid: PubMed IDs for supporting publications. Example: ["12345678"]
- release_date: Date the structure was released. Example: 2005-06-01
- resolution: Resolution of the structure. Example: "2.0 Ã…"
- taxon_id: NCBI Taxonomy ID(s). Example: [83332]
- taxon_lineage_ids: Taxonomic lineage IDs. Example: [83332, 562]
- taxon_lineage_names: Taxonomic lineage names. Example: ["Bacteria", "Proteobacteria"]
- title: Title of the structure. Example: "Structure of DNA polymerase III"
- uniprotkb_accession: UniProtKB accession(s). Example: ["P0A8V2"]

Notes:
- Protein structures may be experimental or computational models.
