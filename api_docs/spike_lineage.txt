Spike lineage record: Represents a spike protein lineage and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

A spike lineage record describes a lineage of spike protein variants, including identifiers, prevalence, region, and metadata. Spike lineages are used for tracking viral evolution and epidemiology.

Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the spike lineage. Example: SL_00001
- lineage: Name of the lineage. Example: "B.1.1.7"
- lineage_of_concern: Whether the lineage is of concern. Example: "yes"
- lineage_count: Number of isolates in the lineage. Example: 100
- country: Country of detection. Example: "USA"
- region: Region of detection. Example: "North America"
- month: Month of detection. Example: "2021-01"
- prevalence: Prevalence of the lineage. Example: 0.15
- growth_rate: Growth rate of the lineage. Example: 1.2
- total_isolates: Total number of isolates. Example: 500
- sequence_features: List of sequence features. Example: ["D614G", "N501Y"]
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2021-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-02-01
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- Spike lineages are used for tracking viral evolution and epidemiology.
