Pathway reference record: Represents a pathway reference and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

A pathway reference record describes a reference pathway, including identifiers, EC numbers, class, and mapping information. Pathway references are used for annotation and comparative pathway analysis.

Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the pathway reference. Example: PATHREF_00001
- pathway_id: Pathway identifier. Example: ko00010
- pathway_name: Name of the pathway. Example: "Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis"
- pathway_class: Class of the pathway. Example: "Metabolism"
- ec_number: Enzyme Commission number. Example: 2.7.1.1
- ec_description: Description of the EC number. Example: "Hexokinase"
- map_location: List of map locations. Example: ["map1", "map2"]
- map_name: Name of the map. Example: "KEGG map00010"
- map_type: Type of map. Example: "KEGG"
- occurrence: Occurrence count. Example: 5
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- Pathway references are used for annotation and pathway mapping.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
