Pathway record: Represents a biological pathway annotated in a genome, typically using KEGG or similar standards.

A pathway record describes a metabolic or regulatory pathway present in a genome, including its identifiers, name, associated EC numbers, and links to genes and proteins involved in the pathway. Pathways are projected onto genomes as part of the annotation process.

Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the pathway record. Example: PATH_00001
- pathway_id: Unique identifier for the pathway. Example: ko00010
- pathway_name: Name or description of the pathway. Example: Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis
- ec_number: Enzyme Commission number associated with the pathway. Example: 2.7.1.1
- ec_numbers: List of Enzyme Commission numbers associated with the pathway. Example: 2.7.1.1, 1.2.1.12
- genome_id: Identifier of the genome where the pathway is annotated. Example: 83332.12
- genome_name: Name of the genome. Example: Escherichia coli K12
- gene_ids: List of gene or feature IDs involved in the pathway. Example: fig|83332.12.peg.1, fig|83332.12.peg.2
- accession: Accession number for the pathway. Example: "P00001"
- alt_locus_tag: Alternative locus tag. Example: "b0001"
- annotation: Source of the annotation. Example: "KEGG"
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- ec_description: Description of the EC number. Example: "Hexokinase"
- feature_id: Feature ID associated with the pathway. Example: fig|83332.12.peg.1
- gene: Gene symbol or name. Example: "dnaN"
- genome_ec: Genome EC number. Example: "2.7.1.1"
- owner: Owner of the record. Example: user@bv-brc.org
- pathway_class: Class of the pathway. Example: "Metabolism"
- pathway_ec: Pathway EC number. Example: "2.7.1.1"
- patric_id: PATRIC-specific ID. Example: fig|83332.12.peg.1
- product: Product of the pathway. Example: "Glucose-6-phosphate"
- public: Whether the record is public. Example: true
- refseq_locus_tag: RefSeq locus tag. Example: "b0001"
- sequence_id: Sequence identifier. Example: "NC_000913.3"
- source: Source of the pathway annotation (e.g., KEGG, BV-BRC). Example: KEGG
- taxon_id: NCBI Taxonomy ID. Example: 83332
- user_read: Users with read access. Example: ["user1", "user2"]
- user_write: Users with write access. Example: ["user1"]
- description: Additional description or notes about the pathway.
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- Pathways are typically based on KEGG maps and EC numbers.
- Not all fields are present for every pathway; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
