Feature sequence record: Represents a biological sequence and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

A feature sequence record describes a nucleotide or protein sequence, including its MD5 checksum, type, and metadata. Sequences are linked to features and genomes.

Fields:
- md5: MD5 checksum of the sequence. Example: 1bc29b36f623ba82aaf6724fd3b16718
- sequence: The nucleotide or protein sequence. Example: "ATGCGT..."
- sequence_type: Type of sequence (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein). Example: "protein"
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- Feature sequences are used for annotation and comparative genomics.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
