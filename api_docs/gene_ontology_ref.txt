Gene ontology reference record: Represents a Gene Ontology (GO) term and metadata in BV-BRC.

A gene ontology reference record describes a GO term, including its identifier, name, definition, and ontology type. GO terms are used for functional annotation of genes and proteins.

Fields:
- go_id: Gene Ontology identifier. Example: GO:0005524
- go_name: Name of the GO term. Example: "ATP binding"
- definition: Definition of the GO term. Example: "Interacting selectively and non-covalently with ATP."
- ontology: Ontology type (e.g., biological_process, molecular_function, cellular_component). Example: "molecular_function"
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- GO terms are used for annotation of genes and proteins.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
