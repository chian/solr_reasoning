Antibiotics record: Represents an antibiotic and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

An antibiotics record describes an antibiotic, including chemical and physical properties, pharmacology, mechanism of action, and identifiers. Antibiotics data are used for AMR research, pharmacology, and annotation.

Fields:
- pubchem_cid: PubChem Compound ID. Example: 12345
- antibiotic_name: Name of the antibiotic. Example: "Ampicillin"
- synonyms: List of synonyms for the antibiotic. Example: ["Penbritin", "Polycillin"]
- cas_id: CAS registry number. Example: "69-53-4"
- atc_classification: List of ATC classification codes. Example: ["J01CA01"]
- canonical_smiles: Canonical SMILES string. Example: "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O"
- isomeric_smiles: Isomeric SMILES string. Example: "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O"
- inchi_key: InChIKey identifier. Example: "BSYNRYMUTXBXSQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N"
- molecular_formula: Molecular formula. Example: "C16H19N3O4S"
- molecular_weight: Molecular weight. Example: "349.4"
- pharmacological_classes: List of pharmacological classes. Example: ["beta-lactam antibiotic"]
- pharmacology: List of pharmacological properties. Example: ["inhibits cell wall synthesis"]
- mechanism_of_action: List of mechanisms of action. Example: ["inhibits transpeptidase"]
- description: List of descriptions. Example: ["Broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic"]
- drugbank_interactions: List of DrugBank interaction IDs. Example: ["DB01060"]
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- pubchem_cid_i: Integer PubChem Compound ID. Example: 12345
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1
