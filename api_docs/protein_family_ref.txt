Protein family reference record: Represents a protein family definition and metadata in BV-BRC.

A protein family reference record describes a protein family, including its unique identifier, product name, type, and metadata. Protein families are used to group related proteins across genomes for comparative analysis.

Fields:
- family_id: Unique identifier for the protein family. Example: PLF_000001
- family_product: Name or description of the protein family. Example: DNA polymerase III family
- family_type: Type of protein family (e.g., PLfam, PGfam, FIGfam). Example: PLfam
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- Protein families are used for functional annotation and comparative genomics.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
