Epitope record: Represents an epitope and associated immunological assay data in BV-BRC.

An epitope record describes a peptide or region recognized by the immune system, including sequence, type, host, and assay results. Epitopes are linked to proteins, organisms, and immunological data.

Fields:
- epitope_id: Unique identifier for the epitope. Example: EPI_00001
- epitope_sequence: Amino acid sequence of the epitope. Example: "SYFPEITHI"
- epitope_type: Type of epitope (e.g., linear, conformational). Example: "linear"
- organism: Name of the organism. Example: "Escherichia coli"
- protein_id: Identifier of the associated protein. Example: "NP_414543.1"
- protein_accession: Protein accession. Example: "P0A8V2"
- protein_name: Name of the protein. Example: "DNA polymerase III subunit beta"
- start: Start coordinate of the epitope. Example: 10
- end: End coordinate of the epitope. Example: 18
- host_name: Name(s) of host organisms. Example: ["human"]
- assay_results: List of assay result identifiers. Example: ["AR_0001"]
- bcell_assays: B-cell assay data. Example: "positive"
- mhc_assays: MHC assay data. Example: "positive"
- tcell_assays: T-cell assay data. Example: "positive"
- total_assays: Total number of assays. Example: 3
- comments: Additional comments. Example: ["high affinity"]
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- taxon_id: NCBI Taxonomy ID. Example: 83332
- taxon_lineage_ids: Taxonomic lineage IDs. Example: [83332, 562]
- taxon_lineage_names: Taxonomic lineage names. Example: ["Bacteria", "Proteobacteria"]
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- Epitopes are regions recognized by antibodies or T-cell receptors.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
