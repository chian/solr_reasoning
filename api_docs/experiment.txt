Experiment record: Represents a biological experiment and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

An experiment record describes a biological experiment, including identifiers, experimenters, protocols, samples, and metadata. Experiments are linked to biosets, genomes, and studies.

Fields:
- exp_id: Unique identifier for the experiment. Example: EXP_0001
- exp_name: Name of the experiment. Example: "E. coli RNA-Seq"

- exp_description: Description of the experiment. Example: "RNA-Seq of E. coli under stress."
- exp_type: Type of experiment. Example: "RNA-Seq"
- exp_poc: Point of contact for the experiment. Example: "Dr. Smith"
- experimenters: Names of experimenters. Example: "Smith et al."
- exp_protocol: List of protocols used. Example: ["standard RNA extraction"]
