Genome AMR record: Represents antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotype and metadata for a genome.

A genome AMR record contains information about the resistance or susceptibility of a genome to specific antibiotics, including phenotype, evidence, and testing details. These data are collected from BioSample, antibiogram records, and curated sources.

Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the AMR record. Example: AMR_00001
- genome_id: Identifier of the genome. Example: 83332.12
- genome_name: Name of the genome. Example: Escherichia coli K12
- antibiotic: Name of the antibiotic tested. Example: ampicillin
- phenotype: Observed resistance phenotype (Resistant, Susceptible, Intermediate). Example: Resistant
- evidence: Source of the AMR designation (e.g., Phenotype, AMR Panel, Comment). Example: Phenotype
- testing_standard: Standard or protocol used for testing (if available). Example: CLSI
- testing_standard_year: Year of the testing standard. Example: 2020
- testing_lab: Laboratory or source of the test (if available). Example: CDC
- testing_platform: Platform or method used for testing (if available). Example: VITEK 2
- measurement: Quantitative measurement (e.g., MIC value). Example: 32
- measurement_sign: Sign for measurement (e.g., ">", "<"). Example: ">"
- measurement_unit: Unit of measurement. Example: ug/ml
- measurement_value: Value of measurement. Example: 32
- panel: Name of the AMR panel (if available). Example: NARMS
- laboratory_typing_method: Laboratory typing method. Example: "disk diffusion"
- laboratory_typing_method_version: Version of the typing method. Example: "v2.0"
- laboratory_typing_platform: Typing platform. Example: "VITEK 2"
- computational_method: Computational method used (if any). Example: "ML classifier"
- computational_method_performance: Performance of computational method. Example: "0.95 accuracy"
- computational_method_version: Version of computational method. Example: "1.0"
- pmid: PubMed IDs for supporting publications. Example: [12345678]
- public: Whether the record is public. Example: true
- resistant_phenotype: Resistant phenotype (if available). Example: "Resistant"
- source: Source of the AMR data. Example: "BioSample"
- taxon_id: NCBI Taxonomy ID. Example: 83332
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- owner: Owner of the record. Example: user@bv-brc.org
- user_read: Users with read access. Example: ["user1", "user2"]
- user_write: Users with write access. Example: ["user1"]
- vendor: Vendor for testing supplies. Example: "bioMÃ©rieux"
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1
- comments: Additional comments or notes.

Notes:
- The 'phenotype' field is the observed result for the antibiotic/genome combination.
- The 'evidence' field indicates how the AMR call was made.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
