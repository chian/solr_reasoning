Sequence feature VT record: Represents a sequence feature variant type and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

A sequence feature VT record describes a variant type for a sequence feature, including identifiers, sequence, and metadata. These records are used for variant analysis and annotation.

Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the sequence feature VT. Example: SFVT_00001
- sf_category: Sequence feature category. Example: "variant"
- sf_id: Sequence feature ID. Example: "SF_00001"
- sf_name: Name of the sequence feature. Example: "DNA polymerase III variant"
- sf_sequence: Sequence of the feature. Example: "ATGCGT..."
- sf_sequence_md5: MD5 checksum of the feature sequence. Example: 1bc29b36f623ba82aaf6724fd3b16718
- sfvt_genome_count: Number of genomes with this variant. Example: "5"
- sfvt_genome_ids: List of genome IDs with this variant. Example: ["83332.12"]
- sfvt_id: Sequence feature VT identifier. Example: "SFVT_00001"
- sfvt_sequence: Sequence of the variant. Example: "ATGCGT..."
- sfvt_sequence_md5: MD5 checksum of the variant sequence. Example: 1bc29b36f623ba82aaf6724fd3b16718
- sfvt_variations: Description of the variations. Example: "A23T, G45C"
- additional_metadata: Additional metadata fields. Example: ["meta1", "meta2"]
- comments: Additional comments. Example: ["predicted variant"]
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01

Notes:
- Sequence feature VT records are used for variant analysis and annotation.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
