Miscellaneous NIAID SGC record: Represents a NIAID SGC target and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

A miscellaneous NIAID SGC record describes a target from the NIAID Structural Genomics Centers, including gene symbols, taxonomic information, and status. These records are used for tracking targets in structural genomics projects.

Fields:
- target_id: Unique identifier for the target. Example: TGT_00001
- gene_symbol_collection: List of gene symbols. Example: ["dnaN", "recA"]
- genus: Genus of the organism. Example: "Escherichia"
- species: Species of the organism. Example: "coli"
- strain: Strain designation. Example: "K12"
- has_clones: Whether clones are available. Example: "yes"
- has_proteins: Whether proteins are available. Example: "yes"
- selection_criteria: Criteria for target selection. Example: "high priority"
- target_status: Status of the target. Example: "in progress"
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- NIAID SGC records track targets for structural genomics.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
