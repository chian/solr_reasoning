Genome sequence record: Represents a genome sequence and associated metadata in BV-BRC.

A genome sequence record describes a nucleotide sequence from a genome, including identifiers, sequence, type, and metadata. Sequences are linked to genomes and features.

Fields:
- sequence_id: Unique identifier for the sequence. Example: SEQ_00001
- genome_id: Identifier of the parent genome. Example: 83332.12
- genome_name: Name of the parent genome. Example: "Escherichia coli K12"
- accession: Accession number for the sequence. Example: "U00096.3"
- chromosome: Chromosome designation. Example: "Chromosome 1"
- plasmid: Plasmid designation. Example: "pK12"
- segment: Segment designation. Example: "Segment 1"
- description: Description of the sequence. Example: "Complete genome sequence."
- sequence: The nucleotide sequence. Example: "ATGCGT..."
- sequence_md5: MD5 checksum of the sequence. Example: 1bc29b36f623ba82aaf6724fd3b16718
- sequence_type: Type of sequence (e.g., DNA, RNA). Example: "DNA"
- sequence_status: Status of the sequence. Example: "complete"
- length: Length of the sequence in base pairs. Example: 4641652
- gc_content: GC content percentage. Example: 50.8
- mol_type: Molecule type. Example: "genomic DNA"
- gi: GenInfo Identifier. Example: 123456
- p2_sequence_id: Secondary sequence ID. Example: 2
- release_date: Date the sequence was released. Example: 2001-05-12
- public: Whether the sequence is public. Example: true
- owner: Owner of the sequence record. Example: "user@bv-brc.org"
- user_read: Users with read access. Example: ["user1", "user2"]
- user_write: Users with write access. Example: ["user1"]
- taxon_id: NCBI Taxonomy ID. Example: 83332
- topology: Topology of the sequence (e.g., circular, linear). Example: "circular"
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- version: Version number of the sequence. Example: 1
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1
