ID reference record: Represents an identifier mapping and metadata in BV-BRC.

An ID reference record describes a mapping between different biological identifiers, including type, value, and related metadata. ID references are used for cross-referencing data across databases.

Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the mapping. Example: ID_00001
- id_type: Type of identifier (e.g., UniProt, RefSeq). Example: "UniProt"
- id_value: Value of the identifier. Example: "P0A8V2"
- uniprotkb_accession: UniProtKB accession. Example: "P0A8V2"
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- ID references are used for cross-referencing biological data.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
