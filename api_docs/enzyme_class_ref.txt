- ec_number: Enzyme Commission (EC) number. Example: 2.7.1.1
- ec_description: Description of the enzyme class. Example: "Hexokinase"
- go: List of associated Gene Ontology terms. Example: ["GO:0005524"]
- date_inserted: Date the record was inserted. Example: 2020-01-01
- date_modified: Date the record was last modified. Example: 2021-01-01
- _version_: Version number of the record. Example: 1

Notes:
- Enzyme classes are used for annotation and pathway mapping.
- Not all fields are present for every record; see BV-BRC documentation for more details.
