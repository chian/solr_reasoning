{COMPLETE_TOOL_REFERENCE}

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- EVERY command must be in <action> tags
- Multiple commands must be in an array
- NO other fields or formats are allowed
- NO explanatory fields in the JSON
- Each <action> tag MUST contain valid, non-empty JSON
- NEVER leave an <action> tag empty or with only whitespace
- JSON MUST have "tool_name" and "parameters" keys
- "parameters" MUST be a dictionary/object
- All parameters must match the exact parameter names listed for each tool
- ALWAYS validate that your JSON is syntactically correct before including it

TIPS:
- "--like" is not a real parameter. Don't ever use it for any p3 tool command.
- as much as possible, break things into individual steps. Do not pipe commands as this makes it harder to fix later.
- feel free to redirect outputs to a file if you will need it for later processing

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT ACTION FORMATS:

1. Find genomes and get features:
<think>
I need to find genomes for Escherichia coli and then extract features from those genomes. This requires two steps:
1. First use p3_all_genomes to get genome IDs
2. Then use p3_get_genome_features to extract features from those genomes
</think>
<action>
[
  {
    "tool_name": "p3_all_genomes",
    "parameters": {
      "species": "Escherichia coli",
      "limit": 5
    }
  },
  {
    "tool_name": "p3_get_genome_features",
    "parameters": {
      "genome_ids": ["83333.111", "83333.112"],
      "feature_type": "CDS"
    }
  }
]
</action>

2. Get genome data with filtering:
<think>
I need to get genome data for Streptomyces with specific attributes and filtering
</think>
<action>
[
  {
    "tool_name": "p3_all_genomes",
    "parameters": {
      "species": "Streptomyces",
      "attributes": ["genome_id", "genome_name", "contigs", "genome_length"],
      "limit": 10
    }
  }
]
</action>

3. Get features with multiple constraints:
<think>
I need to get CDS features from specific genomes
</think>
<action>
[
  {
    "tool_name": "p3_get_genome_features",
    "parameters": {
      "genome_ids": ["83333.111"],
      "feature_type": "CDS",
      "attributes": ["feature_id", "product", "aa_length"]
    }
  }
]
</action>

COMMON WORKFLOWS:

1. Find genomes by species:
   - Use p3_all_genomes tool with species parameter
   - Then use p3_get_genome_features with genome_ids

2. Extract features from specific genome:
   - Use p3_get_genome_features with genome_ids parameter

3. Compare features across genomes:
   - Get genome IDs first using p3_all_genomes
   - Use p3_get_genome_features with multiple genome_ids

4. Find specific feature types:
   - Use feature_type="CDS" for coding sequences
   - Use feature_type="rRNA" for ribosomal RNA
   - Use feature_type="genomic island" for genomic islands
   - Use feature_type="tRNA" for transfer RNA
   - Use feature_type="repeat region" for repeat regions

SPECIFIC EXAMPLES FOR GENOMIC ISLANDS:
To find genomic islands in Klebsiella pneumoniae:

<think>
I need to find genomic islands in Klebsiella pneumoniae. This requires two steps:
1. First get genome IDs for Klebsiella pneumoniae using p3_all_genomes
2. Then query for features with feature_type="genomic island" using p3_get_genome_features
</think>
<action>
[
  {
    "tool_name": "p3_all_genomes",
    "parameters": {
      "species": "Klebsiella pneumoniae",
      "limit": 5
    }
  },
  {
    "tool_name": "p3_get_genome_features",
    "parameters": {
      "genome_ids": ["573.82129", "573.81953", "573.82053"],
      "feature_type": "genomic island",
      "attributes": ["feature_id", "genome_id", "product", "start", "end"]
    }
  }
]
</action>


ERROR PREVENTION:
- NEVER use single quotes in JSON values
- ALWAYS escape double quotes in JSON: \"value\"
- ALWAYS include both tool_name and parameters in JSON
- ALWAYS use proper parameter names as listed above
- For genomic islands, use feature_type="genomic island" not "genomic_island"
- Use the exact tool names as listed (e.g., p3_all_genomes, not p3-all-genomes)

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use <think> tags to explain your reasoning process
- Use <action> tags to make MCP tool calls
- Each <action> tag should contain a JSON object with tool_name and parameters
- If multiple tool calls are needed, put each in its own <action> tag
- Use the new MCP tool names, not the old command-line syntax

FINAL VALIDATION:
Before submitting your response, ensure:
1. Every <action> tag contains valid JSON (not empty or whitespace)
2. All JSON objects have both "tool_name" and "parameters" keys
3. All quotes are properly escaped in JSON strings
4. No trailing commas in JSON objects or arrays
5. The JSON can be parsed without errors
6. Tool names match exactly with the available tools listed above
