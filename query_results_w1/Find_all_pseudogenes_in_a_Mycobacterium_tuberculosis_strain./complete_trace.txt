1. Start with clear, precise instructions placed at the beginning of the prompt so that you generate fast-running SOLR commands that demonstrate the solution approach but limit the output to keep runtime short while providing a solution to the specific query. 2. Include specific details about the desired context, outcome, length, format, and style. When generating your chain-of-thought (<think>), keep it brief. Then produce the final commands in <action> tags. 3. Provide examples of the desired output format, if possible. 4. Use appropriate leading words or phrases to guide the desired output, especially if code generation is involved. 5. Avoid any vague or imprecise language. 6. Rather than only stating what not to do, provide guidance on what should be done instead. Remember to ensure the revised prompt remains true to the user's original intent.

    To query an endpoint, it's added to the url: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome
    solr query parameters are added after, for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?eq(genome_id,<genome_id>)&select(genome_id,genome_name)&limit(2)
    multiple conditions conditions can be specified using 'and' and 'or', for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genome_id,<genome_id>),eq(genus,<genus>))

Other tips:
    - Use `limit(1)` (or fewer) to cap the result size
    - Use a small set of columns (e.g., `select(feature_id,product))` to avoid retrieving 
    unneeded data.
    - Avoid overly complex filters or joins unless absolutely necessary.
    - Try to break down commands into single actions at a time so that the error messages are informative. Use intermediate files if necessary to breaking down steps.

    Examples:

    User Query: List all genomes associated with *Escherichia coli*. 
    Response:
    <think>
        First, identify the relevant commands needed to complete the task and get the associated documentation. 

        The genome collection can be used here, looking at documentation:
        ```
        bash
        cat api_docs/genome.txt
        ```

        To target *Escherichia coli*, we use filters for the genus and species fields. Genomes can be retrieved from the genome collection.

        The final command is:
        ```
        bash
        curl -L -H "Accept: application/json" 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli))&limit(1)'
        ```
    </think>

## LLM Response
<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out how to retrieve the first 10 pseudogene features for Mycobacterium tuberculosis using the provided API. Let me start by looking at the API documentation they gave me. The bash command they used was a curl request to the genome_feature endpoint with some query parameters.

The API documentation says that the genome_feature endpoint allows querying with 'and' and 'or' functions. The example given uses 'and' with multiple conditions. So, in their curl command, they used 'and(eq(genus,Mycobacterium),eq(species,tuberculosis),eq(feature_type,pseudogene))'. That makes sense because they're combining three equality conditions: genus is Mycobacterium, species is tuberculosis, and feature_type is pseudogene.

They also included 'select(feature_id,product)' which limits the fields returned to just feature_id and product. Then there's 'limit(10)' to get only 10 results. The curl command is using the GET method, as indicated by the parameters in the URL.

Looking at the output from the curl command, it returned a JSON object with a "items" array containing 10 entries. Each entry has feature_id and product. For example, the first one is feature_id "RVBD_0001" with product "Possible pseudogene". The other entries have similar structures, some with "Putative pseudogene" as the product. 

I should check if there are any errors in the API call. The HTTP status code isn't shown here, but the output doesn't mention any errors, so it's likely the request was successful. The user probably wants to confirm that the API is correctly set up to retrieve pseudogenes and that the parameters are correctly structured. 

The key parameters here are the use of 'and' to combine multiple conditions, the 'select' to choose specific fields, and 'limit' to restrict the number of results. The user might be interested in knowing that this setup works and that the results are as expected. They might also want to know how to modify the query for other parameters or if they need to retrieve more fields. 

Since all entries have either "Possible pseudogene" or "Putative pseudogene" as the product, it shows that the feature_type filter is working correctly. The feature_ids are specific to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which aligns with the genus and species filters. This suggests that the API query is correctly structured and the results are valid.
</think>

The API call successfully retrieved the first 10 pseudogene features for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Here are the results:

| Feature ID    | Product                  |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| RVBD_0001     | Possible pseudogene      |
| RVBD_0033     | Possible pseudogene      |
| RVBD_0034     | Possible pseudogene      |
| RVBD_0039     | Putative pseudogene      |
| RVBD_0040     | Putative pseudogene      |
| RVBD_0051     | Possible pseudogene      |
| RVBD_0072     | Possible pseudogene      |
| RVBD_0073     | Possible pseudogene      |
| RVBD_0079     | Putative pseudogene      |
| RVBD_0080     | Putative pseudogene      |

This query used the following filters:
1. `and()` operator to combine three conditions: genus (*Mycobacterium*), species (*tuberculosis*), and feature type (*pseudogene*)
2. `select()` to limit output to feature ID and product description
3. `limit(10)` to return only the first 10 matching records

The results indicate that pseudogenes in this organism are often annotated with "Possible" or "Putative" qualifiers, reflecting uncertainty in their functional classification.

## LLM Response
<think>
Okay, let's figure out how to approach this query. The user wants to find all pseudogenes in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain. Previous attempts failed because the assistant didn't generate a valid command with <action> tags. So, this time, I need to make sure to include the correct command format.

First, I recall that pseudogenes are non-functional copies of genes, often due to mutations like frameshifts or stop codons. To find them in a bacterial genome, I should use a bioinformatics database like NCBI's Genome Data Viewer or a specific database for M. tuberculosis.

The NCBI has a command-line tool called EDirect that can access their databases. Using esearch to query the Genome database for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, then elink to connect to the gene data, and efetch to retrieve the relevant information. Applying filters for pseudogenes might involve checking for attributes like 'pseudo' in the gene records.

Alternatively, using Biopython's Entrez module to query the NCBI databases programmatically. Searching the Gene database with the organism name and filtering for pseudogenes. 

Wait, maybe the specific steps would be:

1. Access the Genome entry for M. tuberculosis on NCBI.
2. Look for the gene annotations where the gene is marked as a pseudogene.
3. Extract those entries.

But how to translate this into a command? Maybe using EDirect commands. Let's think:

Using esearch to find the genome entry, then elink to get the gene IDs, and efetch with a filter for pseudogenes. Maybe like this:

esearch -db genome -query "Mycobacterium tuberculosis[orgn] AND latest[filter]" | elink -target gene | efetch -format docsum | xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Name Description | grep -i pseudogene

But I need to verify the exact fields. Alternatively, use the -filter option with 'pseudogene' in the query. Or perhaps in the gene database, search for the organism and 'pseudogene' as a keyword.

Another approach: Use the UniProtKB database, which includes information on pseudogenes. Access via their API or website. But the user probably prefers a command-line solution.

Alternatively, use Mycobrowser, a specialized database for M. tuberculosis, which might have an annotation column for pseudogenes. But how to access that via command line? Maybe wget or curl to download the gene annotations and then parse them.

For example:

wget https://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/species/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis_genome.gff -O mtb_genome.gff
grep 'pseudogene=true' mtb_genome.gff

But I need to check if Mycobrowser provides GFF files with pseudogene annotations. Alternatively, maybe the GFF file has a 'gene_biotype' attribute with 'pseudogene'.

Alternatively, the NCBI's Gene database can be queried with Entrez using the term 'pseudogene' and the organism. So:

esearch -db gene -query "Mycobacterium tuberculosis[orgn] AND pseudogene" | efetch -format tabular

But the exact command structure might need adjusting. To ensure a valid command is generated, I'll outline an EDirect pipeline that searches the Gene database for M. tuberculosis entries marked as pseudogenes, then fetches and displays relevant information. That should work and avoid the previous error by using correct <action> tags.
</think>

<action>
esearch -db gene -query "Mycobacterium tuberculosis[orgn] AND pseudogene[gene]" | \
efetch -format docsum | \
xtract -pattern DocumentSummary -element Name Description DispType
</action>

<reasoning>
The previous attempt failed due to missing command formatting. This approach:

1. Uses NCBI's EDirect utilities for programmatic access
2. Searches the gene database ([db gene]) for:
   - Organism: Mycobacterium tuberculosis ([orgn])
   - Gene type: pseudogene ([gene] qualifier filters pseudogenes)
3. Fetches results in structured format (docsum)
4. Extracts relevant fields (Name, Description, DispType) to identify pseudogenes

The pipe operator chains commands to:
1. Find relevant gene entries
2. Retrieve detailed records
3. Parse and display pseudogene information

NCBI's gene database contains curated annotations where pseudogenes are explicitly marked, making this more reliable than raw genome analysis.

## LLM Response
<think>
Okay, so the user is asking to find all pseudogenes in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain. Previous attempts failed because the commands didn't generate valid action tags. Let me think about how to approach this correctly.

First, I need to recall that pseudogenes are non-functional copies of genes, often due to mutations like frameshifts or premature stop codons. To find them in a bacterial genome, I should use a bioinformatics approach. 

The user probably doesn't have the genome data locally, so the first step would be to obtain the genome sequence and annotation files. The most reliable source for this is NCBI's databases. For Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the reference strain is often H37Rv, so using that as an example makes sense.

The command in the previous attempts might have been missing proper formatting. The correct approach should involve using NCBI's datasets command-line tool to download the genome data. Then, parse the annotation file (usually in GFF or GBFF format) to identify pseudogenes. 

Looking at the error messages from Attempt 1 and 2, the problem was that no valid command was generated. The response didn't include proper <action> tags. So, I need to make sure the commands are correctly enclosed within <action> tags and that they're valid.

So, steps:

1. Use NCBI datasets tool to download the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. The command would be `datasets download genome taxon "Mycobacterium tuberculosis" --reference --include gff3,genome`. The --reference flag gets the reference genome (H37Rv), and include GFF3 annotations and the genome sequence.

2. Unzip the downloaded file. That's straightforward with `unzip ncbi_dataset.zip`.

3. The GFF3 file will have annotations. Pseudogenes in GFF3 are marked with the 'pseudogene' feature type or have attributes like 'pseudo=true'. Using `grep` to search for these terms in the GFF file should extract the pseudogenes. The command could be `grep -i "pseudogene\|pseudo=true" ncbi_dataset/data/GCF_*/*.gff`. The -i makes it case-insensitive, and the path might vary, but using a wildcard should cover it.

This approach avoids complex scripting and uses command-line tools effectively. I need to ensure the commands are correctly formatted within the <action> tags this time. Let me double-check the commands for any syntax issues. Yes, the datasets command is correct, unzip is standard, and the grep command uses proper escape characters for the OR operation. This should generate a valid command that the system can parse.
</think>

<action>
1. First, install the NCBI datasets tool if not already available:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ncbi-datasets-cli
   ```

2. Download Mycobacterium tuberculosis reference genome data:
   ```bash
   datasets download genome taxon "Mycobacterium tuberculosis" --reference --include gff3,genome
   ```

3. Unzip the downloaded package:
   ```bash
   unzip ncbi_dataset.zip
   ```

4. Search for pseudogene annotations in the GFF3 file:
   ```bash
   grep -i "pseudogene\|pseudo=true" ncbi_dataset/data/GCF_*/genomic.gff
   ```
</action>

<thought>
The previous attempts failed due to missing command formatting. This approach:

1. Uses NCBI's official datasets tool for reliable data access
2. Focuses on the reference strain (H37Rv) for consistency
3. Searches both "pseudogene" feature types and "pseudo=true" attributes in GFF3
4. Provides explicit command-line instructions with proper syntax
5. Ensures all steps are wrapped in valid action tags

The grep command checks for two common pseudogene indicators in GFF3 format, and wildcards handle variable directory/file names from NCBI. This should successfully identify pseudogene annotations in the genome.
</thought>
