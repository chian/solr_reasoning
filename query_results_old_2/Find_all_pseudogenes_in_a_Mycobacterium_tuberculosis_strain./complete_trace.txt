# User Query
Find all pseudogenes in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain.

# Attempt 1

## Original Superprompt (before enhancement)
Given the user's initial prompt "{user prompt: Find all pseudogenes in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain.}" enhance it. 1. Start with clear, precise instructions placed at the beginning of the prompt so that you generate fast-running SOLR commands that demonstrate the solution approach but limit the output to keep runtime short while providing a solution to the specific query. 2. Include specific details about the desired context, outcome, length, format, and style. When generating your chain-of-thought (<think>), keep it brief. Then produce the final commands in <action> tags. IMPORTANT: Commands in <action> tags MUST be in JSON format with "action" and "action_input" fields, like this:
    <action>
    {
        "action": "bash",
        "action_input": "your command here"
    }
    </action>
3. Provide examples of the desired output format, if possible. 4. Use appropriate leading words or phrases to guide the desired output, especially if code generation is involved. 5. Avoid any vague or imprecise language. 6. Rather than only stating what not to do, provide guidance on what should be done instead. Remember to ensure the revised prompt remains true to the user's original intent.

    To query an endpoint, it's added to the url: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome
    solr query parameters are added after, for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?eq(genome_id,<genome_id>)&select(genome_id,genome_name)&limit(2)
    multiple conditions conditions can be specified using 'and' and 'or', for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genome_id,<genome_id>),eq(genus,<genus>))

Other tips:
    - Use `limit(1)` (or fewer) to cap the result size
    - Use a small set of columns (e.g., `select(feature_id,product))` to avoid retrieving 
    unneeded data.
    - Avoid overly complex filters or joins unless absolutely necessary.

    Examples:

    User Query: List all genomes associated with *Escherichia coli*. 
    Response:
    <think>
        First, identify the relevant commands needed to complete the task and get the associated documentation. 

        The genome collection can be used here, looking at documentation:
        ```
        bash
        cat api_docs/genome.txt
        ```

        To target *Escherichia coli*, we use filters for the genus and species fields. Genomes can be retrieved from the genome collection.

        The final command is:
        ```
        bash
        curl -L -H "Accept: application/json" 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli))&limit(1)'
        ```
    </think>

## Enhanced Prompt from o1-preview
Generate bash commands to find all pseudogenes in a *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* strain using the SOLR endpoints provided. Use the `genome_feature` collection to retrieve gene feature data. Limit the output to keep runtime short by selecting only necessary fields (e.g., `feature_id`, `product`) and using `limit(1)`. Your commands should be fast-running and demonstrate the solution approach. When generating your chain-of-thought `<think>`, keep it brief. Then produce the final commands in `<action>` tags in JSON format with `"action"` and `"action_input"` fields, like this:

```xml
<action>
{
    "action": "bash",
    "action_input": "your command here"
}
</action>
```

For example, to list all genomes associated with *Escherichia coli*:

<think>
First, identify the relevant API endpoint and documentation for genomes by checking `api_docs/genome.txt`. Use the `genome` collection. Construct a SOLR query to retrieve genomes where `genus` is `Escherichia` and `species` is `coli`. Limit the output by selecting only `genome_id` and `genome_name`, and set `limit(1)`.
</think>

[
    {
        "action": "bash",
        "action_input": "cat api_docs/genome.txt"

    {
        "action": "bash",
        "action_input": "curl -L -H \"Accept: application/json\" 'https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli))&select(genome_id,genome_name)&limit(1)'"
    }
]
</action>

Please apply this method to find all pseudogenes in a *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* strain.

## LLM Response
<think>
Okay, I need to generate a bash command that finds all pseudogenes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using the SOLR endpoints provided. The user mentioned using the genome_feature collection. 

First, I should recall how the SOLR queries are structured. From the example given, the command uses curl with a specific URL that includes query parameters. The format seems to be something like eq(field, value) for equality checks.

Since the goal is to find pseudogenes, I should check which field in the genome_feature collection indicates a pseudogene. Typically, there might be a field like 'annotation' or 'feature_type' that specifies this. But maybe 'product' or another field holds this info. For example, if a gene is a pseudogene, the 'product' might include the term 'pseudogene'. Alternatively, there could be a specific feature_type value for pseudogenes.

In the example, they used the genome collection and selected certain fields. Here, for genome_feature, I need to filter where the organism is Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the feature is a pseudogene. The genome might be specified by the 'genus' and 'species' fields. Wait, but the genome_feature collection might have a 'genome_id' which links to a specific genome. However, if the user wants any strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, perhaps we can query by the 'species' field in genome_feature. Alternatively, maybe the 'taxon_lineage' includes the species. I'm not entirely sure. The user's example used genus and species for the genome collection, so maybe in genome_feature, the same applies.

Assuming that the species can be filtered using eq(species, "tuberculosis") and genus eq(genus, "Mycobacterium"). Additionally, to identify pseudogenes, perhaps the 'product' field contains the word 'pseudogene'. So, a filter could be like match(product, pseudogene). Alternatively, there might be a specific feature_type for pseudogenes. For example, in some databases, the feature_type might be 'pseudogene' or similar. I need to check the documentation for genome_feature to see which fields are available.

The user's example started by checking the API documentation. So the first step should be to check the genome_feature documentation, perhaps with a command like 'cat api_docs/genome_feature.txt' to see the available fields. Then, based on that, construct the query.

Once the documentation is reviewed, suppose that the 'product' field contains the product name, which for pseudogenes might include 'pseudogene'. So, the query would be: and(eq(genus, Mycobacterium), eq(species, tuberculosis), match(product, pseudogene)). Then select the necessary fields like feature_id and product, and add limit(1) to keep it fast.

Alternatively, if there's a specific 'feature_type' field that designates pseudogenes, like eq(feature_type, pseudogene), that would be more accurate. That depends on the structure of the genome_feature data.

Putting this together, the steps are:

1. Check the genome_feature API docs to identify the correct fields for filtering.
2. Construct a SOLR query that combines the species/genus filters with the pseudogene condition.
3. Select only feature_id and product, and apply limit(1).

So the bash commands would first check the documentation, then run the curl command with the appropriate query.

<classification>


**Classification:** PARTIAL SUCCESS  
**Explanation:**  
The output lists the schema for the `genome_feature` data type, including attributes like `feature_type`, which could be used to identify pseudogenes (e.g., filtering for `feature_type = "pseudogene"`). However, it does **not** contain actual data entries for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* pseudogenes. The user must query this schema with specific filters to retrieve the requested information. While the schema is necessary for constructing the correct query, the absence of direct pseudogene data makes this partial success.
</classification>

<justification>


The provided output **does not** successfully answer the query to "find all pseudogenes in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain." Here's why:

---

### **Missing Critical Information**
1. **No Actual Data Rows Are Shown**  
   The output is a schema description (column names and data types) for a `genome_feature` dataset, **not actual data entries**. While it describes what fields exist (e.g., `feature_type`, `genome_name`), it lacks concrete data values (e.g., rows where `feature_type = "pseudogene"` and `genome_name = "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"`).

2. **No Direct Evidence of Pseudogenes**  
   Pseudogenes are typically indicated by `feature_type = "pseudogene"` or `product/notes` annotations. The schema includes a `feature_type` field, but there is no example of its actual content to confirm if pseudogenes are explicitly categorized. Similarly, the `product` and `notes` fields (which might contain pseudogene-related terms) are not populated with real values.

3. **No Genome-Specific Filtering**  
   While `genome_name` is listed as a field, there is no data showing which genomes (e.g., *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*) are represented in the dataset or how to filter for them.

---

### **Key Gaps for the Query**
- Without seeing instances where `feature_type` explicitly contains `pseudogene`, it is impossible to confirm if pseudogenes are even annotated in this dataset.
- Even if pseudogenes exist in the dataset, there is no way to link them to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* without actual values in `genome_name`.

---

### **What Would Answer the Query Successfully?**
A successful response would require:
1. Filtered data rows where:
   - `feature_type = "pseudogene"` (or equivalent annotation in `product/notes`),
   - `genome_name = "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"`.
2. Inclusion of identifiers like `gene`, `patric_id`, or `accession` to list specific pseudogenes.

---

### **Conclusion**
The output only describes the structure of a dataset, not the data itself. To answer the query, **actual data rows** must be retrieved using the schema’s attributes (e.g., querying `feature_type` and `genome_name` for specific values). This output lacks the necessary pseudogene annotations and genome-specific results.
</justification>

<solution>


**Answer:**  
The command output does **not** directly provide pseudogene data for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. To answer the query, you must:  

1. **Run a filtered query** using the schema’s attributes, for example:  
   ```sql
   SELECT gene, accession, product, notes
   FROM genome_feature
   WHERE feature_type = 'pseudogene'
     AND genome_name = 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis';
   ```  
   (Adjust syntax for your database/API.)  

2. **Verify results** include actual pseudogene entries (e.g., `feature_type` explicitly lists `pseudogene`, or `product/notes` fields contain pseudogene annotations).  

**Missing Until Queryed:** Confirmation that pseudogenes exist in the dataset and are linked to *M. tuberculosis*.
