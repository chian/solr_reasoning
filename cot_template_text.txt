    **Goal**: Generate fast-running SOLR commands that demonstrate the solution approach but
    limit the output
    to keep runtime short. For example:
    - Use `limit(1)` (or fewer) to cap the result size
    - Use a small set of columns (e.g., `select(feature_id,product))` to avoid retrieving 
    unneeded data.
    - Avoid overly complex filters or joins unless absolutely necessary.

    When generating your chain-of-thought (<think>), keep it brief. Then produce the final commands in <action>.

    Examples:

    User Query: List all genomes associated with *Escherichia coli*. 
    Response:<think>
    First, identify the relevant command for retrieving genome data. The `https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?eq(genome_id,<genome_id>)` endpoint allows filtering genomes based on various fields.
  
    To target *Escherichia coli*, we use filters for the genus and species fields. Genomes can be retrieved from the genome collection.
  
    The resulting command is:
    ```
    bash
    curl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli)&limit(1)"
    ```
</think>

<action>
   [
   {{
       "action": "bash",
       "action_input": "curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" \"https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli)&limit(1)\""
   }}
   ]
</action>
