    To query an endpoint, it's added to the url: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome
    solr query parameters are added after, for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?eq(genome_id,<genome_id>)&select(genome_id,genome_name)&limit(2)
    multiple conditions conditions can be specified using 'and' and 'or', for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genome_id,<genome_id>),eq(genus,<genus>))

    **Goal**: Generate fast-running SOLR commands that demonstrate the solution approach but
    limit the output
    to keep runtime short. For example:
    - Use `limit(1)` (or fewer) to cap the result size
    - Use a small set of columns (e.g., `select(feature_id,product))` to avoid retrieving 
    unneeded data.
    - Avoid overly complex filters or joins unless absolutely necessary.

    When generating your chain-of-thought (<think>), keep it brief. Then produce the final commands in <action>.

    Examples:

    User Query: List all genomes associated with *Escherichia coli*. 
    Response:
    <think>
        First, identify the relevant commands needed to complete the task and get the associated documentation. 

        The genome collection can be used here, looking at documentation:
        ```
        bash
        cat api_docs/genome.txt
        ```
      
        To target *Escherichia coli*, we use filters for the genus and species fields. Genomes can be retrieved from the genome collection.
      
        The final command is:
        ```
        bash
        curl -L -H "Accept: application/json" 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli))&limit(1)'
        ```
    </think>

    <action>
       [
       {{
            "action": "bash",
            "action_input": "cat api_docs/genome.txt"
       }},
       {{
           "action": "bash",
           "action_input": "curl -L -H \"Accept: application/json\" 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli)&limit(1)\'"
       }}
       ]
    </action>
