Given the user's initial prompt "{{user prompt: {user_query}}}" enhance it. 1. Start with clear, precise instructions placed at the beginning of the prompt so that you generate fast-running SOLR commands that demonstrate the solution approach but limit the output to keep runtime short while providing a solution to the specific query. 2. Include specific details about the desired context, outcome, length, format, and style. When generating your chain-of-thought (<think>), keep it brief. Then produce the final commands in <action> tags. IMPORTANT: Commands in <action> tags MUST be in JSON format with "action" and "action_input" fields, like this:
    <action>
    {{
        "action": "bash",
        "action_input": "your command here"
    }}
    </action>
3. Provide examples of the desired output format, if possible. 4. Use appropriate leading words or phrases to guide the desired output, especially if code generation is involved. 5. Avoid any vague or imprecise language. 6. Rather than only stating what not to do, provide guidance on what should be done instead. Remember to ensure the revised prompt remains true to the user's original intent.

    To query an endpoint, it's added to the url: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome
    solr query parameters are added after, for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?eq(genome_id,<genome_id>)&select(genome_id,genome_name)&limit(2)
    multiple conditions conditions can be specified using 'and' and 'or', for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genome_id,<genome_id>),eq(genus,<genus>))

Other tips:
    - Use `limit(1)` (or fewer) to cap the result size
    - Use a small set of columns (e.g., `select(feature_id,product))` to avoid retrieving 
    unneeded data.
    - Avoid overly complex filters or joins unless absolutely necessary.

    Examples:

    User Query: List all genomes associated with *Escherichia coli*. 
    Response:
    <think>
        First, identify the relevant commands needed to complete the task and get the associated documentation. 

        The genome collection can be used here, looking at documentation:
        ```
        bash
        cat api_docs/genome.txt
        ```
      
        To target *Escherichia coli*, we use filters for the genus and species fields. Genomes can be retrieved from the genome collection.
      
        The final command is:
        ```
        bash
        curl -L -H "Accept: application/json" 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli))&limit(1)'
        ```
    </think>
