    To query an endpoint, it's added to the url: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome
    solr query parameters are added after, for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?eq(genome_id,<genome_id>)&select(genome_id,genome_name)&limit(2)
    multiple conditions conditions can be specified using 'and' and 'or', for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genome_id,<genome_id>),eq(genus,<genus>))

    **Goal**: Generate fast-running SOLR commands that demonstrate the solution approach but
    limit the output
    to keep runtime short. For example:
    - Use `limit(1)` (or fewer) to cap the result size
    - Use a small set of columns (e.g., `select(feature_id,product))` to avoid retrieving 
    unneeded data.
    - Avoid overly complex filters or joins unless absolutely necessary.

    When generating your chain-of-thought (<think>), keep it brief. Then produce the final commands in <action>.

    Examples:

    User Query: List all genomes associated with *Escherichia coli*. 
    Response:
    <think>
        First, identify the relevant commands needed to complete the task and get the associated documentation. 

        The genome collection can be used here, looking at documentation:
        ```
        bash
        cat api_docs/genome.txt
        ```

        To target *Escherichia coli*, we use filters for the genus and species fields. Genomes can be retrieved from the genome collection.

        The final command is:
        ```
        bash
        curl -L -H "Accept: application/json" 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli))&limit(1)'
        ```
    </think>

    <action>
       [
       {
            "action": "bash",
            "action_input": "cat api_docs/genome.txt"
       },
       {
           "action": "bash",
           "action_input": "curl -L -H \"Accept: application/json\" 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli)&limit(1)\'"
       }
       ]
    </action>

User Query: Retrieve the annotated features of a Salmonella enterica genome.


## LLM Response
<think>
Okay, the user wants to find the annotated features of a Salmonella enterica genome. Let's break it down.

First, annotated features are typically found in the genome_feature collection. So I need to check what fields are available there. Maybe check the documentation using cat api_docs/genome_feature.txt to see the relevant fields like feature_id, product, etc.

Next, I need to filter for Salmonella enterica genomes. The genome collection has taxonomy info, but maybe the genome_feature collection has a field related to the species. Alternatively, maybe I need to first get a genome_id from the genome collection for a Salmonella enterica strain and then use that to query genome_feature.

Wait, the genome_feature collection might have a 'genome_name' or 'species' field directly. Let me check. If not, then the process would be: find a genome_id from the genome collection where genus is Salmonella and species is enterica, then query genome_feature with that genome_id.

But to simplify and avoid joins, if genome_feature has a species field, then I can filter directly. So first, check the genome_feature's fields. Suppose it has 'species' and 'genus' fields. Then the query would be to genome_feature with eq(genus,Salmonella) and eq(species,enterica). If not, then I need to get genome_id(s) from the genome collection first.

Assuming genome_feature has the necessary fields, I can directly query it. Use select to get important fields like feature_id, product, and maybe genome_id. Limit the results to 1 for speed. So the curl command would be to the genome_feature endpoint with filters on genus and species, select a few fields, and limit(1).

<classification>


**Classification:** PARTIAL SUCCESS

**Explanation:**  
The output provides a detailed schema of genome feature attributes (e.g., `feature_type`, `product`, `go`, `annotation`), which are critical for understanding annotated features. However, it does not include actual *Salmonella enterica*-specific data (e.g., gene names, functional annotations, or sequences). The user requested retrieval of annotated features, but this output only describes the structure of the data rather than the data itself. Thus, it partially answers the query by showing what attributes are available but fails to provide the specific genomic annotations.
</classification>

<justification>


The provided output **does not successfully answer the query** to "retrieve the annotated features of a *Salmonella enterica* genome." Here’s why:

### ❌ Missing Critical Information:
1. **No Actual Genome Data**:
   - The output lists **database schema attributes** (metadata about fields in a dataset) but does **not contain specific data** for a *Salmonella enterica* genome. Attributes like `aa_sequence_md5`, `start`, `end`, or `product` are empty columns here; their values are not populated.

2. **No Taxon-Specific Filtering**:
   - While `taxon_id` is listed as an attribute, there is no filtering or actual data tied to *Salmonella enterica* (taxon ID 59201 or 28901, depending on the strain). The output is generic and not specific to this organism.

3. **Lacks Annotations**:
   - Fields like `annotation`, `go` (Gene Ontology terms), `figfam_id`, or `product` could theoretically hold annotations, but the output shows only their data types (e.g., "case insensitive string")—**no actual annotations** (e.g., gene names, functional descriptions, pathways) are provided.

### ✔️ What *Is* Included:
- The output defines the **structure of a genome feature dataset**, including fields relevant to annotations (e.g., `gene`, `product`, `go`, `feature_type`). If populated with data, these fields could describe annotated features like genes, proteins, and their functional roles.

### Conclusion:
This output is a **schema description**, not actual genome annotation data. To answer the query, the command should return **records** from this schema where `genome_name` or `taxon_id` corresponds to *Salmonella enterica* and includes populated fields like `gene`, `product`, and `go`. Without populated values, this output does not fulfill the request.
</justification>

<solution>


**Solution:**  
To successfully retrieve annotated features for *Salmonella enterica*, modify the command to:  

1. **Filter by the specific taxon ID** (e.g., `taxon_id == 59201` for *S. enterica* subsp. *enterica*).  
2. **Return populated fields** like `gene`, `product`, `go`, `feature_type`, and `aa_sequence`, ensuring actual data (not just schema) is fetched.  

**Example Command Structure** (adapt to your tool/database):  
```  
query --table genome_features --filter "taxon_id = 59201" --fields feature_type,gene,product,go,annotation,start,end  
```  

**Expected Output:**  
A list of features (e.g., genes, tRNAs) with annotations like gene names, functional descriptions, Gene Ontology terms, and positional coordinates.  

Without populated data fields or organism-specific filtering, the output remains a schema and not actionable annotations.
