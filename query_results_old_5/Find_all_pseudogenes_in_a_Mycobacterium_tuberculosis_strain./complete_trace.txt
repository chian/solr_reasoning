CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- EVERY command must be in <action> tags
- EVERY command must use ONLY these fields:
  - "action": "bash"
  - "action_input": "the command"
- Multiple commands must be in an array
- NO other fields or formats are allowed
- NO explanatory fields in the JSON
- NO additional JSON structure
- USE FEW-SHOT PROMPTING TECHNIQUES

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT FORMAT:

Input: "List all Pseudomonas aeruginosa genome IDs."
Output:
<action>
{
    "action": "bash",
    "action_input": "curl -s \"https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Pseudomonas),eq(species,aeruginosa))&select(genome_id)\""
}
</action>

Input: "Get features from genome 287.3167 that are proteins"
Output:
<action>
{
    "action": "bash",

}
</action>

1. Start with clear, precise instructions placed at the beginning of the prompt so that you generate fast-running SOLR commands that demonstrate the solution approach but limit the output to keep runtime short while providing a solution to the specific query. 2. Include specific details about the desired context, outcome, length, format, and style. When generating your chain-of-thought (<think>), keep it brief. Then produce the final commands in <action> tags. 3. Provide examples of the desired output format, if possible. 4. Use appropriate leading words or phrases to guide the desired output, especially if code generation is involved. 5. Avoid any vague or imprecise language. 6. Rather than only stating what not to do, provide guidance on what should be done instead. Remember to ensure the revised prompt remains true to the user's original intent.

    To query an endpoint, it's added to the url: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome
    solr query parameters are added after, for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?eq(genome_id,<genome_id>)&select(genome_id,genome_name)&limit(2)
    multiple conditions conditions can be specified using 'and' and 'or', for example: https://bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genome_id,<genome_id>),eq(genus,<genus>))

Other tips:
    - Use `limit(1)` (or fewer) to cap the result size
    - Use a small set of columns (e.g., `select(feature_id,product))` to avoid retrieving 
    unneeded data.
    - Avoid overly complex filters or joins unless absolutely necessary.
    - Try to break down commands into single actions at a time so that the error messages are informative. Use intermediate files if necessary to breaking down steps.

    Examples:

    User Query: List all genomes associated with *Escherichia coli*. 
    Response:
    <think>
        First, identify the relevant commands needed to complete the task and get the associated documentation. 

        The genome collection can be used here, looking at documentation:
        ```
        bash
        cat api_docs/genome.txt
        ```

        To target *Escherichia coli*, we use filters for the genus and species fields. Genomes can be retrieved from the genome collection.

        The final command is:
        ```
        bash
        curl -L -H "Accept: application/json" 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Escherichia),eq(species,coli))&limit(1)'
        ```

## Enhanced Prompt from o1-preview
<think>
First, identify the relevant commands needed to complete the task and get the associated documentation.

We need to find pseudogenes in a *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* strain. Pseudogenes can be found in the `genome_feature` collection, and they are annotated with `feature_type` as `"pseudogene"`.

First, we'll select a *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* genome by filtering the `genome` collection using `genus` and `species`. We can retrieve a `genome_id` using:

```
curl -L 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Mycobacterium),eq(species,tuberculosis))&select(genome_id)&limit(1)'
```

Assuming we get `genome_id` as `"1773.164"`, we can then query the `genome_feature` collection for pseudogenes in that genome:

```
curl -L 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome_id,1773.164),eq(feature_type,pseudogene))&select(feature_id,product)&limit(1)'
```
</think>

{
    "action": "bash",
    "action_input": "curl -L 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Mycobacterium),eq(species,tuberculosis))&select(genome_id)&limit(1)'"
},
{
    "action": "bash",
    "action_input": "curl -L 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome_id,1773.164),eq(feature_type,pseudogene))&select(feature_id,product)&limit(1)'"
}
]
</action>

## LLM Response
<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how to get pseudogenes from a Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome using the BV-BRC API. Let's start by recalling the user's steps.

First, they mentioned querying the genome collection to get a genome_id. The command uses curl to filter by genus and species, selecting just the genome_id and limiting to 1 result. That makes sense to ensure we're working with a specific genome. I should run that command to get the actual genome_id, but the example used 1773.164. Maybe the actual response might be different, so it's important to check.

Once the genome_id is obtained, the next step is to query the genome_feature collection. The key here is filtering by both genome_id and feature_type being pseudogene. The example uses the given genome_id and selects feature_id and product, which are the identifiers and their associated products. The limit(1) is probably to test the query, but in practice, you might want more results.

Wait, I should make sure that the feature_type is exactly "pseudogene". Maybe there are variations, but according to the user, that's how it's annotated. So the query should work as long as the data is correctly structured in BV-BRC's database.

I'll need to execute both curl commands. The first one gets the genome_id, which I'll substitute into the second command. If the first command returns a different genome_id, the second command must use that instead of 1773.164. Let me test the first command first.

After running the first curl, suppose the response is a JSON array with the genome_id. Extract that value. Then, plug it into the second curl command's genome_id parameter. The second query should then return the pseudogenes' feature_id and product.

I need to ensure that the syntax of the API queries is correct, especially the URL encoding parts. The 'and(eq(...),eq(...))' structure seems right for combining filters. Also, using 'select' to specify which fields to return helps in getting only necessary data.

If there are no pseudogenes, the result might be empty. But the user expects some, given that they provided an example. Checking the documentation for genome_feature to confirm the possible feature_types would be good, but the user says pseudogenes are under "pseudogene".

Potential issues: API rate limits, network errors, or changes in the API structure. But following the user's example should work if the API is stable. Also, ensuring that the commands are run in sequence, using the actual genome_id from the first response.
</think>

The first command retrieves a genome_id for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*:
```bash
curl -L 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Mycobacterium),eq(species,tuberculosis))&select(genome_id)&limit(1)'
```
**Example Output** (your actual `genome_id` may vary):
```json
[
  {
    "genome_id": "1773.164"
  }
]
```

Using the obtained `genome_id`, this command lists pseudogenes:
```bash
curl -L 'https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome_id,1773.164),eq(feature_type,pseudogene))&select(feature_id,product)&limit(1)'
```
**Example Output**:
```json
[
  {
    "feature_id": "fig|1773.164.peg.1073",
    "product": "Pseudogene (possible frameshift with 1773.164.peg.1074)"
  }
]
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Filter Genomes**: The first query identifies a *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* genome by filtering the `genome` collection.
2. **Find Pseudogenes**: The second query uses the `genome_id` to search the `genome_feature` collection for entries where `feature_type` is `pseudogene`, returning their identifiers and annotations.

Adjust `limit(1)` to retrieve more results as needed.

<classification>


**Classification:** FAILURE  

**Explanation:**  
1. **Type of Data Requested:** The user asked for pseudogenes in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. The output shows no pseudogenes returned (final `[]` indicates empty results).  
2. **Quantity/Completeness:** The query specifies "all" pseudogenes, but no data was retrieved.  
3. **Additional Criteria:** No extra criteria were specified, but the critical failure is due to command-line errors (`json: command not found`, syntax errors) that prevented proper execution and data retrieval.  

The errors indicate the command failed to execute correctly, and the output contains no pseudogene data. Partial progress (e.g., genome ID detection) does not fulfill the core request.
</classification>

<justification>


The output **does not successfully answer the query** to find pseudogenes in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Here's why:

---

### **Critical Issues**  
1. **No Pseudogene Data Returned**  
   The final output is `[]`, indicating an empty result set. No actual pseudogene identifiers or annotations are present.

2. **Persistent Script/Command Errors**  
   Multiple errors dominate the output:
   - Syntax errors (`missing ]`, `unexpected end of file`)  
   - Missing commands (`json: command not found`, `genome_id:: command not found`)  
   These indicate the script/tool used to fetch data was improperly formatted or had dependency issues (e.g., requiring `json` CLI tools that are not installed).

3. **Incomplete Execution**  
   The slow transfer stats (`~2 seconds`, `100 bytes received`) suggest partial execution, but the errors prevented meaningful data retrieval.

---

### **What’s Missing**  
A successful output would include:  
- Explicit pseudogene identifiers (e.g., locus tags like `Rv0001`).  
- Annotations confirming pseudogene status (e.g., "frameshift," "inactivated").  
- Strain-specific metadata (e.g., genome assembly version).  

---

### **Root Cause**  
The command failed due to technical errors in the script/tool, not because the data is unavailable. The correct genome ID (`33892.18`) was identified, but subsequent steps to extract pseudogene data were disrupted by syntax and dependency issues.

---

### **Next Steps**  
1. Fix the script/tool:  
   - Validate syntax (address `missing ]` and `unexpected end of file`).  
   - Install required dependencies (e.g., `jq` for JSON parsing instead of `json`).  
2. Retry with a validated method like NCBI’s API or a dedicated genomics platform (e.g., Ensembl Bacteria, PATRIC).  

*Output is dominated by errors, not biological data – the query remains unanswered.*

                    Please provide a new approach to answer the original query:
                    Find all pseudogenes in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain.

                    Remember to:
                    1. Consider why the previous attempts failed
                    2. Adjust the approach based on the error messages or results
                    3. Try a different strategy if the previous ones weren't successful
                    4. Include your reasoning in <think> tags and your final commands in <action> tags
                

## LLM Response
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The user wants to find all pseudogenes in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain. Previous attempts used the BV-BRC API but had various issues. Let me look at those attempts to see where they went wrong.

First, looking at Attempt 1: The curl command was used to get a genome_id for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The result was {"genome_id":"33892.18"}, but the command output showed some percentage numbers which might be progress indicators from curl, not actual errors. However, the Classification says FAILURE due to command execution error, which might be a misinterpretation. Maybe the actual issue was that the genome_id retrieved (33892.18) wasn't used correctly in subsequent steps.

Attempt 8 then used genome_id 1773.164 (maybe from another source?) to query genome_features for pseudogenes. The result was an empty array [], which indicates no data found. The classification here is a FAILURE because the response was empty. But why? Maybe that genome doesn't have pseudogenes, or the feature_type parameter is incorrect.

Other attempts tried using 'json' or square/curly brackets directly in the command line, which are invalid commands, leading to errors like 'command not found' or syntax issues. Those were clearly user errors in command structure.

So the main issues seem to be:

1. Selecting the correct genome_id for a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain that actually has pseudogenes.
2. Correctly querying the BV-BRC API for genome features where feature_type is pseudogene.
3. Properly formatting the curl command and processing the JSON response.

Let me check the BV-BRC API documentation to confirm the correct parameters. The API endpoint for genome_feature likely uses parameters like 'and(eq(genome_id,...), eq(feature_type,...))'. The 'feature_type' for pseudogenes should be verified. Perhaps "pseudogene" is correct, but maybe the actual value is different, like "pseudo" or another term. If the previous query returned an empty result, maybe the feature_type is not correctly specified.

Another possibility is that the genome_id used (1773.164 or 33892.18) does not have pseudogenes. So we might need to first retrieve a valid genome_id for a strain that does have pseudogenes. Alternatively, perhaps the genome query needs to be adjusted to get the correct genome_id.

Let me adjust the strategy step by step:

1. First, find a valid genome_id for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The first attempt got 33892.18, but maybe there are multiple genomes. Let's increase the limit to get more genomes and pick one that's a complete genome or a reference strain.

2. Check if the BV-BRC API's genome_feature endpoint uses "pseudogene" as the feature type. Maybe there's a typo or different terminology. Alternatively, perhaps pseudogenes are under another category, like 'pseudo' or 'pseudogenic'.

3. Once we have a correct genome_id and feature_type, execute the curl command again to fetch the pseudogenes.

Let me try modifying the initial genome query to get more genome_ids. For example:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Mycobacterium),eq(species,tuberculosis))&select(genome_id,strain)&limit(5)"

This would retrieve 5 genome entries along with their strain names. Maybe selecting a reference strain that's well-annotated would yield pseudogenes.

Assuming we get a genome_id from this query, next, use that in the genome_feature query. If the feature_type is indeed "pseudogene", but still no results, maybe check for alternative feature types. For example, in some databases, pseudogenes are labeled as "pseudo" or have a different classification. Alternatively, checking the annotation might involve looking for a 'pseudogene' in the product field.

Alternatively, the API might require a different parameter for pseudogenes. For example, instead of feature_type, maybe using 'annotation' or another field. Consulting the API documentation would clarify, but since I can't access it, maybe trial and error.

Wait, in the user's Attempt 8, they got an empty array. Maybe that specific genome (1773.164) doesn't have pseudogenes. So using a different genome_id could work. Let's first try to get a valid genome_id, perhaps the first one from the initial query (33892.18), and then check for pseudogenes.

Let me try:

Command 1: Retrieve genome_ids for Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Mycobacterium),eq(species,tuberculosis))&select(genome_id,strain)&limit(5)"

Suppose this returns multiple genome_ids. Pick one, say 33892.18.

Then, query the genome_features for that genome_id with feature_type=pseudogene:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome_id,33892.18),eq(feature_type,pseudogene))&select(feature_id,product)"

If this returns data, then problem solved. If not, maybe the feature_type is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps pseudogenes are not classified under feature_type but under another attribute. Another approach is to filter based on the 'product' field containing 'pseudogene':

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome_id,33892.18),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))&select(feature_id,product)"

This uses the 'ilike' operator to search for 'pseudogene' in the product name, case-insensitive.

But the exact syntax depends on the API's capabilities. If the BV-BRC API supports ilike or substring matches, this could work.

Alternatively, check if the problem was the genome_id. Maybe 33892.18 is a different strain. Let's check the first attempt's genome_id again.

In Attempt 1, the genome_id was 33892.18. Then Attempt 8 used 1773.164. Perhaps there's a mistake in the genome_id. Maybe the correct genome_id for a strain with pseudogenes is different.

Another possibility: Pseudogenes might not be present in all strains, or the API might require a different approach. For example, some databases have pseudogene annotations as part of the feature's attributes rather than a feature_type. If BV-BRC's API doesn't categorize pseudogenes under feature_type, then the query would return empty.

If that's the case, then filtering by product name might be better. So the adjusted command would use a filter on 'product' containing 'pseudogene' instead of 'feature_type'.

In summary, the steps are:

1. Find a correct genome_id for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
2. Query genome_features for that genome_id with either feature_type=pseudogene or filtering product names containing 'pseudogene'.
3. Adjust API parameters based on possible discrepancies in the feature_type or product fields.

So, new approach:

First, get a valid genome_id. Let's try the original one from Attempt 1: 33892.18.

Then, instead of filtering by feature_type=pseudogene, try filtering the product field:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome_id,33892.18),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))&select(feature_id,product)&limit(10)"

If this returns results, then that's the way to go. If not, maybe the product uses a different term, like 'pseudo' or 'frameshift'.

Alternatively, check the API documentation (assuming the user can't but I can recall). BV-BRC's API uses RQL (Resource Query Language), where 'ilike' is for case-insensitive pattern matching. The '%' signs are wildcards.

Wait, in some APIs, the wildcard might be '*' instead of '%', but in RQL, I think it's '%' based on some examples. For example, 'ilike(product,*pseudogene*)' might be incorrect syntax. Wait, let's check:

In RQL, the 'ilike' operator uses % as wildcards. So to search for any occurrence of 'pseudogene' in the product field, the correct syntax would be 'ilike(product,%pseudogene%)'.

So adjusting the command accordingly:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome_id,33892.18),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))&select(feature_id,product)"

This should return features where the product mentions 'pseudogene'. Let's see if this works.

If that still gives an empty result, maybe there's no pseudogenes in that genome, or the terminology is different. Then try a different genome_id.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial genome query needs to be more specific. For example, filter for reference strains or specific assemblies.

So step 1: Get a genome_id of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain that is a reference or has annotations.

Perhaps using the following query to get genome_ids where the strain is a reference:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Mycobacterium),eq(species,tuberculosis),eq(reference_genome,true))&select(genome_id,strain)&limit(1)"

If this returns a genome_id, use that in the genome_feature query.

Assuming this gives a genome_id, proceed.

Putting it all together, the new approach would be:

1. Find a reference genome_id for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
2. Query genome_features for that genome_id where the product contains 'pseudogene' (using ilike).
3. Return the feature_id and product.

If that still fails, perhaps check the actual data in the BV-BRC website manually to understand how pseudogenes are annotated. For instance, if the user goes to the website, searches for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, selects a genome, and checks the features, they might see how pseudogenes are labeled. However, since we can't do that here, relying on the API structure is necessary.

Another possibility is that the 'feature_type' is not the right parameter. Maybe 'pseudogene' is a subclass under another type. Or the API uses 'gene' as the feature_type and uses a 'pseudogene' attribute elsewhere.

Alternatively, check the schema of the genome_feature object in BV-BRC's API. For example, if there's a 'pseudogene' boolean field or a 'gene_type' field. If such fields exist, querying based on that would be better.

But without documentation access, trial and error is needed.

So the revised commands would be:

First, get a genome_id:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Mycobacterium),eq(species,tuberculosis))&select(genome_id)&limit(1)"

If this returns 33892.18 again, then use that. Then try querying genome_features with ilike on product.

Alternatively, if even with ilike it returns nothing, maybe the problem is that pseudogenes are not annotated in the product field. Perhaps they are annotated in a different way, like 'note' or 'function'.

In some databases, pseudogenes are indicated by the presence of certain keywords or in specific fields. Without knowing the exact schema, it's challenging, but perhaps trying different fields would help.

Alternatively, use a different API endpoint. For example, the BV-BRC may have a specific endpoint for pseudogenes, but I don't know that.

Another angle: The previous attempt 8 used genome_id 1773.164 and received an empty array. Maybe this genome doesn't have pseudogenes. So trying a different genome_id is essential.

In summary, the key steps are:

1. Retrieve a valid genome_id.
2. Use the correct query parameters to filter pseudogenes in genome_features.

Assuming that 'feature_type' is not working and the correct approach is to search the product field for 'pseudogene', the final command should be:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genus,Mycobacterium),eq(species,tuberculosis),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))&select(feature_id,product,genome_id)"

But wait, does the genome_feature endpoint allow filtering by genus and species directly, or do I need to first get the genome_ids? Because each genome_feature is associated with a genome_id, which in turn has genus and species. So to get all pseudogenes across all Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, perhaps the query should first get all genome_ids and then loop through them, but that's complex in a single curl command.

Alternatively, the API may allow joining across tables. But RQL may have limitations. For example, the genome_feature endpoint might have a 'genome_id' field which can be linked to the genome's genus and species. But if the API allows nested queries or joins, maybe we can filter directly in the genome_feature query. However, that might not be possible. Let's check.

If the genome_feature API allows filtering based on the genome's genus and species, then the query could be:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome.genus,Mycobacterium),eq(genome.species,tuberculosis),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))&select(feature_id,product,genome_id)"

But this depends on whether the genome_feature endpoint has access to the genome's fields via a join. If that's possible, then this single query would retrieve all features across all Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes where the product contains 'pseudogene'. This would answer the original query without needing to first get individual genome_ids.

However, the user's initial attempts filtered by genome_id, suggesting they tried to get a specific strain. The original query is to find pseudogenes in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain (singular), so maybe any strain is acceptable. Thus, using a query that gets genome_features from any Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain where product contains 'pseudogene'.

If the API supports this, this would be the optimal approach. Let me test this theory.

Assuming the API allows querying genome_feature based on the associated genome's genus and species, using something like 'genome.genus' and 'genome.species' in the query parameters.

But how to structure the query? For example:

and(eq(genome.genus,Mycobacterium),eq(genome.species,tuberculosis),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))

If that's valid, then the curl command would be:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome.genus,Mycobacterium),eq(genome.species,tuberculosis),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))&select(feature_id,product,genome_id)"

But I need to ensure that the field names are correct. Maybe it's 'genome.genus' or 'genome_genus', depending on the API's structure. Without documentation, it's a guess, but trying this could work.

If this query returns results, then it's a success. Otherwise, perhaps another approach is needed.

Another strategy: Since querying genome_features across all genomes of a species might return too much data, limit to one genome and check. For example:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome_id,33892.18),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))&select(feature_id,product)"

If this returns pseudogenes, then the feature_type parameter was the issue. The previous attempts used 'pseudogene' as feature_type, which might not be the correct value.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct feature_type is 'pseudo' or 'pseudogenic region'.

Another approach: Check the possible values for feature_type in the BV-BRC API. This can be done by querying the schema or distinct values. For example:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/distinct/feature_type"

This would return all distinct feature_type values. But without knowing if this endpoint exists, it's a guess. If it does, the user could find the correct value for pseudogenes.

But since I'm limited to the previous attempts' information, maybe the feature_type is not the correct parameter. Hence, focusing on product ilike 'pseudogene%' is better.

Putting this all together, the best possible new approach is to query the genome_feature endpoint with a filter on genus and species (either via genome_id or via joined fields) and look for 'pseudogene' in the product field.

If the API allows joining, the command would look like:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome.genus,Mycobacterium),eq(genome.species,tuberculosis),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))&select(feature_id,product,genome_id)&limit(10)"

This command would attempt to join the genome_feature with the genome's genus and species and filter for features where the product contains 'pseudogene'.

If this works, it will return the desired pseudogenes. If not, the user may need to first find genome_ids and then iterate through them.

Since the user's original attempts tried to first get a genome_id and then query features, perhaps that's the intended approach, but with a correct feature_type or product filter.

In conclusion, the most promising next step is to query the genome_feature endpoint with a product filter for 'pseudogene' and valid genome_id, or directly filter by genus and species if possible.
</think>

To find all pseudogenes in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain, the key is to use the correct API query parameters and ensure the genome_id is valid. Previous attempts failed due to incorrect genome_ids or using the wrong feature_type. By searching the product field for "pseudogene" and using a valid genome_id, we can retrieve the relevant data.

<action>
curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome/?and(eq(genus,Mycobacterium),eq(species,tuberculosis))&select(genome_id)&limit(1)"
</action>

Assuming the genome_id from the above command is "33892.18", use it to query genome features with "pseudogene" in the product field:

<action>
curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome_id,33892.18),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))&select(feature_id,product)"
</action>

If no results, try searching across all Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes without specifying a genome_id:

<action>
curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome.genus,Mycobacterium),eq(genome.species,tuberculosis),ilike(product,%pseudogene%))&select(feature_id,product,genome_id)"

**Summary:**  
1. **Key Data:** The query returned a single genome_id `33892.18` but **no pseudogene-specific data** (e.g., `feature_id` or `product` details).  
2. **Errors/Warnings:** None critical; the output includes standard curl progress logs (not errors).  
3. **Critical ID:** `genome_id: 33892.18` is the only actionable identifier for follow-up analysis.  
4. **Implication:** The absence of pseudogene details suggests either (a) incomplete results, (b) truncated output, or (c) a mismatch in search filters (e.g., `%pseudogene%` pattern).  

**Next Steps:**  
- Use `genome_id: 33892.18` to query BV-BRC for **specific features** (e.g., refine filters or verify pseudogene annotations).  
- Check if the original search term (`%pseudogene%`) aligns with BV-BRC’s annotation conventions.



**Summary:**  
The API request failed with a **400 error (URI malformed)**. The most likely cause is improper URL encoding of special characters (e.g., the `%` symbol in `%pseudogene%` was not escaped as `%25`).  

**Critical Information:**  
- No pseudogene data retrieved due to API error.  
- **Action Required:** URL-encode special characters in the `ilike(product,...)` filter (replace `%` with `%25`).  
- Example fix: `ilike(product,%25pseudogene%25)`  

**Omitted:** Network transfer stats (irrelevant to debugging the API error).



**Summary:**  

1. **Error Encountered**: The API request failed with a **400 (Bad Request)** due to a malformed URI.  
2. **Potential Issue**: The `ilike(product,%pseudogene%)` filter may have improper encoding (e.g., unescaped `%` characters).  
3. **No Data Retrieved**: No pseudogene records (feature IDs, products, genome IDs) were returned due to the error.  

**Actionable Steps**:  
- **Fix URI Encoding**: Replace `%` with `%25` in the `ilike` parameter to properly encode the query (e.g., `ilike(product,%25pseudogene%25)`).  
- **Verify API Syntax**: Ensure URL parameters comply with the BV-BRC API documentation (e.g., encoding spaces, special characters).  
- **Retry Query**: Execute the corrected command to fetch pseudogene data.
</summarized_observation>

<classification>


**Classification:** FAILURE  
**Explanation:**  

1. **User's Request**: Find pseudogenes in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (no quantity or additional criteria specified).  
2. **Output Analysis**:  
   - The command failed with a **400 error** (malformed URI) due to unencoded `%` characters in the API filter.  
   - **No pseudogenes** were returned; the error prevented any valid data retrieval.  
3. **Key Rule**: A command that fails to execute (e.g., due to API errors) or returns no valid data matching the query is classified as **FAILURE**.  

**Conclusion**: The API error blocked the retrieval of pseudogenes, making the result incomplete. Fixing the URL encoding is required for success.
</classification>

<justification>


The command output **does not successfully answer the query** ("Find all pseudogenes in a *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* strain"). Here's why:

---

### **Critical Issues**  
1. **API Error (400 Bad Request):**  
   - The query failed due to a **malformed URI**, specifically improper encoding of the `%` symbol in the `ilike(product,%pseudogene%)` filter.  
   - The `%` character in URLs must be escaped as `%25`, so the correct filter should be `ilike(product,%25pseudogene%25)`.  
   - **Result:** No pseudogene data was retrieved due to this error.

2. **No Pseudogene-Specific Information:**  
   - While a `genome_id: 33892.18` is listed, there are **no pseudogene annotations** (e.g., `feature_id`, product names, coordinates) associated with it in the output.  
   - The genome ID alone does not confirm pseudogenes; it merely identifies a strain in the database.

---

### **Implications**  
- The output reflects a **technical failure** (HTTP 400 error), not biological evidence.  
- The lack of pseudogene data is due to an **invalid API request**, not necessarily an absence of pseudogenes in the strain.  

---

### **Next Steps**  
1. **Fix the URL Encoding:** Replace `%pseudogene%` with `%25pseudogene%25` to resolve the 400 error.  
2. **Re-run the Corrected Query:** This will likely retrieve pseudogene records (if annotated in the database).  
3. **Verify Annotation Conventions:** Ensure BV-BRC uses the term "pseudogene" in its annotations (e.g., some databases may use "pseudo" or other abbreviations).  

Without these corrections, the query remains unanswered.

## LLM Response
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out why the previous attempts didn't work and how to adjust the approach. The original query is to find all pseudogenes in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain. 

Looking at the previous attempts, there were a few issues. First, Attempt 1 and 16 used the genome endpoint with genus and species filters and got a genome_id, but then subsequent commands to get features failed. Attempts 8 and 17 tried querying the genome_feature endpoint with genome_id and pseudogene, but they either got an empty result or a 400 error. The errors like "URI malformed" suggest there's a problem with the URL encoding, especially with special characters like '%'. 

In the query parameters, using 'ilike(product,%pseudogene%)' without proper URL encoding might be causing the server to misinterpret the request. The '%' signs are used for wildcards in SQL-like queries, but in URLs, they need to be percent-encoded as '%25'. The previous attempts didn't encode these, leading to malformed URIs.

Also, Attempt 18 tried combining genome filters with the product filter in the genome_feature endpoint but also got a 400 error. This might be because the way the query parameters are structured isn't correct. Maybe the API expects a different syntax for combining conditions or referencing genome attributes from the genome_feature endpoint.

Another thing to consider is the feature_type parameter. Attempt 8 used 'eq(feature_type,pseudogene)', but perhaps the correct feature_type for pseudogenes isn't 'pseudogene' exactly. Maybe the API uses a different term, like 'pseudo' or something else, or maybe the 'product' field contains 'pseudogene' as a substring, which would require using ilike with proper encoding.

So the adjustments needed are:

1. Properly URL-encode the '%' characters in the ilike filter by replacing them with '%25'.
2. Ensure the query parameters are correctly structured, possibly using the correct field names and combining conditions properly in the API's query language.
3. Try using the 'feature_type' parameter again but check if the correct value is used. If that's not working, rely on searching the 'product' field for 'pseudogene' occurrences with proper wildcards and encoding.

Let's first try querying the genome_feature endpoint directly, combining the genome genus and species filters with a search in the product field for 'pseudogene', using proper URL encoding for the '%' signs. That way, we can get all features that have 'pseudogene' in their product description from any Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome, without needing to first get the genome_id.

The API query structure should look something like:
and(eq(genome.genus,Mycobacterium),eq(genome.species,tuberculosis),ilike(product,%25pseudogene%25)) 

Here, each '%' is encoded as '%25'. Also, use the correct path to combine the genome's genus and species in the genome_feature endpoint. 

The select clause should include the desired fields like feature_id, product, genome_id. And set a limit, maybe, for testing, but the user probably wants all results.

So the curl command would be:

curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome.genus,Mycobacterium),eq(genome.species,tuberculosis),ilike(product,%25pseudogene%25))&select(feature_id,product,genome_id)&limit(10)"

Testing this with limit=10 first to see if it works. The key changes here are encoding the % as %25 in the URL and structuring the query parameters correctly. Hopefully, this avoids the URI malformed error and returns the required pseudogenes.
</think>

<action>
curl -L "https://www.bv-brc.org/api/genome_feature/?and(eq(genome.genus,Mycobacterium),eq(genome.species,tuberculosis),ilike(product,%25pseudogene%25))&select(feature_id,product,genome_id)"
</action>

**Reasoning:**
1. **URL Encoding Fix:** Previous attempts failed due to unencoded `%` characters in the `ilike` filter. Replaced `%` with `%25` to properly encode wildcards.
2. **Direct Query:** Combined genus/species filters directly in the `genome_feature` endpoint to avoid separate genome ID lookups.
3. **Field Selection:** Used `select(feature_id,product,genome_id)` to retrieve relevant pseudogene information across all *M. tuberculosis* strains.
4. **Simplified Structure:** Removed unnecessary brackets/commands from earlier attempts that caused shell syntax errors.

<classification>


**Classification:** FAILURE

**Explanation:**  
The user requested pseudogenes in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* without specifying quantity or additional criteria. The command output shows a `400` error ("URI malformed"), indicating failure to execute due to an invalid request format. No pseudogene data was returned—only an error message and network transfer logs. Since the command failed to retrieve any valid results, this meets the criteria for **FAILURE**.
</classification>

<justification>


The provided output **does not successfully answer the query** about finding pseudogenes in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Here’s why:

1. **Error Response**:  
   The output includes `{"status":400,"message":"URI malformed"}`, indicating the command failed due to an invalid or improperly formatted request. A **400 error** means the server could not process the request, likely due to a syntax issue in the URL or parameters used.

2. **No Biological Data**:  
   There is **no information about pseudogenes** (e.g., gene names, annotations, coordinates) in the output. The response contains only technical error details and transfer statistics (e.g., `% Total`, `Dload`), which are irrelevant to the query.

3. **Root Cause**:  
   The malformed URI prevented the command from reaching the intended database or API endpoint (e.g., NCBI, Ensembl, or a pathogen-specific resource). Without successful communication with such a resource, no gene data could be retrieved.

**Conclusion**: The output reflects a technical failure in the command execution, not biological results. To answer the query, the command must be corrected to properly access a genomic database (e.g., using a valid URI and parameters).
